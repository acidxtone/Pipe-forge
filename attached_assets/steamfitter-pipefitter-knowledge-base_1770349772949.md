Trade Entrance Exam Study Guide 3  What is a trade entrance exam? If you are taking an apprenticeship program in Alberta, you must meet the educational requirements for your trade before you can start your technical training. If you cannot prove you meet the educational requirements for your trade, you can write a trade entrance exam. Passing this exam will prove that you have the basic educational requirements for technical training in your trade. If you pass a trade entrance exam with a mark of 70% or higher, you are eligible to attend technical training. Trade entrance exams are given by Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training and can be written at any Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Office (see page 34 &35 for locations). What’s the exam like? There are five different trade entrance exams one for each of the five different clusters of trades. Each cluster includes trades and occupations that have similar skill and knowledge requirements.

*Source: 077_Entrance_Study_Guide*

For example, the Construction Craft Labourer occupation and the Hairstylist trade are both in Cluster 1. These two careers are very different, but require a similar knowledge of English, mathematics and science in their first year of technical training. (see page 6 for a list of the trades and occupations in each cluster).

*Source: 077_Entrance_Study_Guide*

The trade entrance exam for each cluster includes questions that test for educational requirements for the trades and occupations in that cluster. The exams are made up of 100 multiple-choice questions that cover the areas of English/reading comprehension, mathematics and science.

*Source: 077_Entrance_Study_Guide*

Depending on which cluster the trade is in, there will be a set number of questions from each of these areas as shown in the chart below.

*Source: 077_Entrance_Study_Guide*

You have 3 hours to complete your exam. A mark of 70% or greater is required to pass the trade entrance exam.

## CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS 31 TO 34

Multiple Choice Exam Writing Strategies

*Source: 077_Entrance_Study_Guide*

Watch Your Time For every exam it is important to calculate the amount of time you can spend on each section or question according to the number of marks it is worth. (Do the easy questions or sections first - this is helpful for calming nerves and establishing your concentration.) If your exam is all multiple choice, you may want to note where you should be after one hour and after two hours to ensure you aren't falling too far behind. It is important to work at a fairly quick pace; multiple choice exams are notorious for being long.

*Source: 077_Entrance_Study_Guide*

Process the Question Careless mistakes are often made when students rush through the "stem" of the question, missing important information. Read the question carefully, noting key terms. Watch for negative or positive phrasing, or qualifying words like "always" or "never" which can drastically change the meaning of a statement. If you don't understand the stem, ask the exam supervisor for clarification. Before you look at the list of possible responses, try to recall the answer on your own. Then look at the alternatives to see which one best matches your answer. As you read through the possible responses, make a mental note of the ones you know are wrong. This will mean less reading time if you have to come back to the question later. If none of the selections seems close, re-read the question and try to determine what you missed. If you still can't get it, go on. Something in another question may trigger your memory so you can recall the answer later.

xi INTRODUCTION Choosing a Career The purpose of this book is twofold: (1) to acquaint high- school students with the advantages of a career as a worker in the piping trades, (2) to serve as a reference for workers in the pipe-fitting trades who encounter problems on the job. Fortunate indeed is a high-school graduate who has selected a career to pursue for life. By the second year of high school, if they have had good guidance from their parents and/or school counselors, many students who plan to con- tinue their formal education are deciding which college or university to apply to and what kind of courses to enroll in. Are all high-school graduates suitable candidates for college? Not necessarily. Many are still trying to find out who they are. As an alternative to college, the author suggests that the high-school student consider the many advantages of apprenticeship training in one of the branches of the piping trades. The time to start investigating college scholarships and/or apprenticeship programs is during the second year of high school. This book explains the scope of work of various branches of the piping trades. Apprenticeship and Trade Schools Apprenticeship Apprenticeship offers the best opportunities in on-the-job paid training and related classroom instruction. The time to start apprenticeship is upon graduation from high school. Applicants for union apprenticeship must be at least 18 years old and in good physical condition and must have a high-school diploma or its equivalent.

The author, a member of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting, Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada for over 60 years, recommends apprenticeship training as a union member. Local unions train members in all phases of the plumbing and pipefitting trades. The value of union membership becomes more apparent upon close examina- tion. The surest way to protect one’s wages, health insur- ance, and retirement plan is through union membership. Most apprenticeship programs are fully implemented at the local level by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee (JAC) of the particular trade. Unionized construction is one of the few industries in which management, labor, and government cooperate. Management (the building contractors) assures itself of a pool of trained qualified workers; labor (the craft unions) maintains a mar- ketable product, the skilled journeyman; and the apprentice is given the opportunity to receive excellent vocational training at virtually no cost (on-the-job training) and to earn while he or she learns. Women are accepted as apprentices in the piping trades. Many women have served as apprentices, learned a trade, worked in the field as journeymen, and gone on to open a business. Vocational Schools For those who have missed the opportunity to apply for apprenticeship, there are excellent trade or vocational schools. Upon completion of courses at these schools, graduates should be qualified to pass proficiency tests and obtain licenses in their trade. A list of many U.S. and Canadian schools and their loca- tions will be found in the Appendix. Career Outlook The piping trades are among the highest-paid construction occupations. Apprentices usually begin at 50 percent of the xii Introduction

wage rate of skilled tradesmen. After an initial waiting period, apprentices receive the same benefits as skilled tradesmen.

1. MATH AND METRICS In the not too distant past, a book such as this would have started with some basic math: addition, subtraction, multi- plication, and long division. But with today’s apprenticeship classes, on-the-job training, and widespread use of calcula- tors, a chapter devoted to basic math is unnecessary. Quite often, especially on large construction jobs, job con- ditions require that offsets in pipe runs be made. Numbers called “constants,” taken from trigonometric tables, are used to calculate offsets. These numbers are shown and explained in Chapter 2, “Calculating Offsets.” Many times, problems encountered on the job involve the use of fractions. Pipefitters seldom, if ever, work with fractions other than 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 3⁄8, 1⁄2, 5⁄8, 3⁄4, and 7⁄8. Using the decimal equivalents of these fractions is much easier than using the fractions themselves. As a memory aid, Table 1-1 shows the decimal equivalents of fractions from 1⁄64 to 1 inch. Table 1-1 Decimal Equivalents of Fractions Inches Decimal Equivalent Inches Decimal Equivalent 1⁄64 0.015625 7⁄16 0.4375 1⁄32 0.03125 29⁄64 0.453125 3⁄64 0.046875 15⁄32 0.46875 1⁄20 0.05 31⁄64 0.484375 1⁄16 0.0625 1⁄2 0.5 1⁄13 0.0769 33⁄64 0.515625 5⁄64 0.078125 17⁄32 0.53125 1⁄12 0.0833 35⁄64 0.546875 1⁄11 0.0909 9⁄16 0.5625 3⁄32 0.09375 37⁄64 0.578125 (continued) 1

It is often necessary to find the capacity of a round tank. The more steps involved in solving a problem, the more likely a person is to make a mistake. The old standard method (with tank measured in inches) is: Formula: D2 �0.7854 �Length (L) �231 gallons. (D �D �D2) We’ll use our calculator to solve these problems. D of Tank �12 in L �60 in Step 1. 12 �12 (D2) �144 Step 2. 144 �60 �8640 Step 3. 8640 �0.7854 �6785.856 Step 4. 6785.856 �231 �29.376 gal—(four steps needed) Now, let’s use either of two three-step methods with the same size tank. Method 1—tank measured in inches. D �12 in L �60 in Formula: D2 �L �0.0034 gallons Step 1. 12 �12 �144 Step 2. 144 �60 �8640 Step 3. 8640 �0.0034 �29.376 Note The answer is the same, but one less step is needed, thus there is less chance of a mistake. Math and Metrics 3

4 Math and Metrics Method 2—with tank measured in inches and feet. D �12 in L �5 ft Formula: D2 �L �0.0408 � gallons Step 1. 12 �12 �144 Step 2. 144 �5 �720 Step 3. 720 �0.0408 �29.376 Note Here again, the answer is the same as in the other methods, with one less step needed. As a result, there is less chance of making a mistake. The above methods can also be used to find the liquid capacity of piping. In the example below, use Method 2. Example How many gallons of foam-water concentrate solution will be needed to fill the following pipe footage? 200 ft of 6�fire main 500 ft of 4�fire main 200 ft of 1�drops to sprinkler heads Using Method 2, we find: 6 in 6 �6 �200 �0.0408 �293.76 gal 4 in 4 �4 �500 �0.0408 �326.40 gal 1 in 1 �1 �200 �0.0408 � 8.16 gal Total gallons needed 628.32 gal The above formulas can be used in many other calcula- tions performed by pipefitters.

Working with Metrics The changeover from the English measuring system, which we are all familiar with, to the metric system, which the U.S. government is now adopting, affects all building trades. The principal unit of the metric system is the meter, which corresponds roughly to the yard as a unit of length. The change to metric in the United States has been excep- tionally slow. Using the metric system became national policy under the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. Today, most packaged products are measured in liters or grams as well as in pints, quarts, gallons, ounces, or pounds. The metric system is used for the legal definition of the yard and pound. Thinking back to our school days, everyone had a 12� ruler. One scale, the one we all used, was marked off in inches. Another scale, directly below the inch scale, was marked off in metric units such as centimeters and millimeters. However, very few students in the U.S. ever used the metric scale. In many cases, students never had the metric scale or the metric system explained to them. Yet, the metric system, once learned, is simpler and far more accurate than the English system. American workmen, especially in the building trades, have always worked with inches, feet, yards, and miles. The transition to the metric system will not be easy; however, the metric system is here and in wide use now, so we might as well make the best of the situation. Plan measurements formerly shown in feet and inches will, under the conversion to metric, be shown in millime- ters, centimeters, meters, and kilometers. (They may or may not be shown in feet and inches as well.) The Construction Metrification Council of the National Institute of Building Sciences in Washington, DC, states that many federal projects are turning to the metric system. The following projects are now under way or will be under construction soon: Math and Metrics 7

8 Math and Metrics • The Defense Medical Facilities program (a $400 to 500 million project) began the shift to the metric system in 1995. • The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Air Force (all Air Force work since January 1994 has been in metric measurements), the Public Health Service, and the office of the Secretary of Defense are currently working on metric pilot projects with more planned. Estimates for these projects vary from $30 to 60 million. • The General Services Administration had, as of 1993, $1.5 billion in planning, design, or construction of projects all using metric measurements. All work designed by the GSA since January 1994 has been in metric. • The Department of Energy is building the Super Collider project at a cost over $8.2 billion. This project is also being constructed using metric measurements. • The Smithsonian Institution is planning two new facil- ities with a cost of over $150 million. Both will be built using metric measurements. A great deal of money is being invested in metric con- struction projects. The work is there. All construction workers—especially those in the piping trades—will find knowledge of the metric system essential to getting and hold- ing a job. Foremen and job superintendents will be chosen from those with a working knowledge of the metric system as well. The metric system is based on the “rule of ten.” Any basic unit is made larger or smaller by multiplying or divid- ing it by simple powers of ten. The metric system is a deci- mal system. In fact, we use it every day when we deal with money. Just as one dollar, divided by ten, equals ten dimes, one meter divided by ten, equals ten decimeters. Under the

same principle, one dollar divided by one hundred, equals one hundred cents, as does one meter, which when divided by one hundred, equals one hundred centimeters. So, we’re already using metric in our money. Construction workers, however, are used to thinking in inches and feet. Chang- ing to metrics will be much simpler if measurements are thought of in terms of tenths and hundredths—or dimes and pennies. Table 1-3 shows only the metric terms that will affect the work of pipefitters. This table explains the relationship of metric terms, the symbols for these terms, and the impor- tance of the decimal point in working out metric problems. A misplaced decimal point will result in a completely wrong answer.

All pipe sizes will still be identified as they are now, in inch size, but inside and outside diameters will be shown in both English and metric units. The meter is the base unit of the metric system and is defined as one ten-millionth of the distance on the earth’s surface from the equator to either pole. Its value in inches should be remembered. 1 meter �39.37079 inches. Table 1-5 defines the meter and shows the inch equiva- lents of millimeters. Table 1-6 shows the conversion from inches to millimeters.

2. CALCULATING OFFSETS Most of the common offsets used in piping runs are made with 45�, 60�, and 111⁄4�fittings, in that order. The constants shown in Table 2-1 are used to calculate these offsets. Examples are shown below. Fig. 2-1 shows a simple offset, using 45�elbows. The X in the inset shows the take-off (allowance) from the end of the thread in the fitting to the center of the fitting. Table 2-1 Multipliers for Calculating Simple Offsets To When Find Known Multiply Using 60� Using 45� Using 221⁄2� Using 111⁄4� Side Side Is Side Elbows By Elbows By Elbows By Elbows By T S S 1.155 1.414 2.613 5.125 S T T .866 0.707 0.383 0.195 R S S 0.577 1.000 2.414 5.027 S R R 1.732 1.000 0.414 0.198 T R R 2.000 1.414 1.082 1.019 R T T 0.500 0.707 0.924 0.980 To find the travel, the center-to-center measurement be- tween two angled fittings when the set is known, the multi- plier for the angle fitting is used. Example 1 What is the length of side T for a 45�offset if side S is 191⁄2 in? The side T is found in the first column of Table 2-1. The known side, S, is shown in the second column of Table 2-1. The constant, or multiplier, for 45�offsets, 1.414, is shown in the fifth column. Answer T �S �1.141 T �191⁄2 �1.414 �27.573 in (round off to 271⁄2 in) 14

16 Calculating Offsets The known side, S, is shown in column 2 of the Table. T �191⁄2 �1.155 �22.522 in (round off to 221⁄2 in) Example 5 What is the length of side S if side T is 8 in? S �8 �0.866 �6.92 in (round off to 7 in) Example 6 What is the length of side R if side S is 81⁄2 in? R �81⁄2 �0.577 �4.90 in (round off to 5 in) To find set when run is known, travel when run is known, and run when travel is known, use the same procedure shown in examples above. The calculated measurements using the constants shown are center-to-center measurements. Deduct the end-to-center measurements of the fittings (X in inset of Fig. 2-1) to get the end-to-end measurement of the cut pipe. The set, run, and travel for an 111⁄4�and a 221⁄2�offset can also be calculated from the constants shown in Table 2-1. Example 1 What is the set (S) for a 221⁄2�offset if the travel (T) is 15 in? Answer Multiply side T (15) �.383 �5.74. Round to 53⁄4 in. The set is 53⁄4 in. Example 2 What is the run (R) of a 221⁄2�offset if the set (S) is 8 in? Answer Multiply side S (8) �2.414 �19.31. Round to 191⁄4. The run is 191⁄4 in. Example 3 What is the travel of a 221⁄2�offset if the run is 10 in?

34 3. PIPE WELDING WITH OXYACETYLENE AND ARC Oxyacetylene Welding This section is designed to aid the novice who wants to learn the techniques needed to produce good oxyacetylene welds. Many highly skilled welders have learned this technique by picking up a torch and practicing on scrap pipe until they became proficient. The only way to learn welding is through the “hands-on” method—it cannot be learned from a book. However, if a person has a basic understanding of the subject (knowing how to hold the torch and welding rod at the cor- rect angle for various positions as the weld is being made), the job can be easy. A list of very important precautions to follow when using oxyacetylene equipment will be found at the end of this section. Setting up the Equipment Oxygen and acetylene tanks should either be mounted and secured to a cart or securely fastened to a bench, wall, or post. These cylinders should never be stored or used in any position other than an upright one. Before mounting the gauges on the tanks, open the valves 1⁄4 turn and then quickly close them. This is called “cracking” the valves and will blow out any for- eign matter that might otherwise get into the gauges. Connect the oxygen regulator (Fig. 3-1) to the oxygen tank and the acetylene regulator (Fig. 3-2) to the acetylene tank. Two different kinds of acetylene cylinder connections are used in the United States: the CGA 510 connection has left-hand threads, internal on the cylinder outlet; the CGA 300 connection has right-hand threads, external on the cylin- der outlet. Tighten both connections firmly with a wrench. To close the valve, rotate the pressure-adjusting screw on each regulator to the left, counterclockwise, until it turns freely. The regulator valves must be closed before pressure is applied to the regulators. Stand to the side but where you can

The oxygen valve has a wheel handle and should be turned to full open by turning it to the left, or counterclockwise. The acetylene valve must also be turned to the left, or counterclockwise. The acetylene valve may have a wheel handle or may require a wrench to open it. In either case, it should be opened only one-quarter turn, and if a wrench is used, the wrench should be left on the valve in order for the valve to be turned off quickly in case of an emergency. When the valves are opened, full tank pressure will be shown on the high-pressure gauges. Oxygen and acetylene hoses are made specifically for gas welding and cutting purposes. The oxygen hose is green, and the acetylene hose is red. The oxygen hose has right-hand coupling nuts for connecting to the regulator and welding barrel. Acetylene coupling nuts have left-hand threads. When connecting the oxygen and acetylene hoses, the cou- pling nuts should thread on easily, requiring only a slight tightening with a wrench. Oxygen and acetylene connections are made with a ground joint; do not use thread lubricants, oil, or grease on these connections. A typical welding torch and a typical cutting head are shown in Fig. 3-3. Both the welding torch and the cutting head can be mounted on the same barrel. The barrel contains the needle valves controlling both the oxygen and acetylene supply to the welding torch and the cutting torch. When the cutting head is used, the needle valve on the head controls the oxygen supply to the cutting (or large) orifice in the head. The small orifices in the cutting head are used to bring the metal up to heat for cutting. With all connections made, turn off the needle valves on the welding torch barrel by turning the valve knobs clockwise. Then, open the oxygen regulator by turning the screw on the regulator clockwise, and set the pressure on the low-pressure gauge to approximately 25 psig (pounds per square inch gauge). Then, open the acetylene regulator by turning the screw on the regulator clockwise until a setting of 7 to 10 psig shows on the low-pressure gauge.

Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc 37 is painted red above 15 psig. Because acetylene becomes unstable at a working pressure above 15 psig, acetylene must never be used at a pressure above 15 psig. Test all connections for leaks by turning off the oxygen and acetylene supplies at the regulators. Turn the screws on the regulators counterclockwise, loosen them, and check that the needle valve knobs on the torch barrel are turned off. This leaves pressure on the hoses between the regulator Fig. 3-3 A Victor ® torch handle (A), cutting attachment with cutting tip (B), and welding nozzle (C) (Courtesy Victor ® a Thermadyne ® Company) (C) WELDING NOZZLE (A) TORCH HANDLE (B) CUTTING ATTACHMENT WITH CUTTING TIP

CAUTION If it should ever be necessary to retighten a coupling nut after the outfit has been set up, close the cylinder valve before tightening the nut. Eye Protection Welding goggles or a welding hood with shaded glass must be worn when you are performing acetylene cutting or welding. Shaded glass in the color range of 4 to 6 is generally used. Lighting the Torch for Welding With the welding tip mounted on the torch barrel, open the acetylene valve on the torch about one-quarter turn and immediately light the flame with a friction lighter. Never use a match! Reduce the acetylene flow by throttling the torch acetylene valve until the flame starts to produce black smoke. Then, increase acetylene flow until the smoke disap- pears. Open the oxygen valve slowly until a neutral flame appears. A neutral flame is shown in Fig. 3-4. To adjust the volume of the flame, alternately increase the acetylene and oxygen. It is important to use the correct size welding tip for the job in hand. If the tip is too large and must be throttled back to produce the flame volume needed, the torch will “pop” and “backfire.” If the flame burns away from the tip, throttle back on the oxygen, then the acetylene, maintaining a neutral flame until the flame returns to the tip. If the flame goes out and burns back within the torch, creating a shrill whistling noise, turn the torch off immediately. This is called a “flashback” and indicates that something is wrong, either with the torch or with operation of the torch. Allow the torch to cool before attempting to relight it. Practicing on Pipe The first step in making the weld is to cut and bevel two pieces of pipe, each piece 8 or 10 in long. A soapstone crayon

Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc 39 can be used to mark the cut. The working pressures on the oxygen and acetylene gauges should be set as described ear- lier. Mount the cutting head on the torch barrel. The cutting torch (Fig. 3-5) should be ignited and adjusted for a soft neu- tral flame, using the needle valve knobs on the barrel. (A soft flame is one that has a long, blue inner cone.) The needle valve on the cutting head should be opened by turning the knob counterclockwise. The torch should be held at an angle as shown in Fig. 3-5 in order to bevel the pipe.

40 Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc Fig. 3-5 Correct position for making a beveled cut the metal is red hot, depress the cutting lever (applying oxy- gen at secondary gauge pressure) and move the cutting torch around the edge, rolling the pipe as the cut is made. Use a chipping hammer (Fig. 3-6) to remove any slag at the cut edge. Lay the pieces in an angle or channel iron, as shown in Fig. 3-7, leaving a 1⁄16-in gap between the pieces, and make four tack welds 90° apart. Making the Tack Welds Mount the welding tip on the barrel. A #3 (drill size 53) or #4 (drill size 49) tip should be used for welding on 4 or 6-in pipe along with a 1⁄8-in mild steel welding rod. Light the torch and adjust it for a soft neutral flame. The flame volume will depend on the size of the tip being used. Generally, the flame should be as large as the welding tip will permit without the soft blue tip of a neutral flame pulling away from the end of the welding tip. A tack weld is a single small weld made at the bottom of the beveled edges of the pieces to be welded. The tack weld is made by playing the torch flame on both pieces, heating the metal until it is white hot, then touching the welding rod to one

When the forehand method is used, the welding rod moves ahead of the torch’s tip. When the backhand method is used, the torch moves ahead of the welding rod. In pipe weld- ing when the pipe cannot be rotated, the welder must be able to switch easily from forehand to backhand. The forehand technique is used to weld from the bottom to the top of the pipe. The backhand technique is used to weld from the top to

Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc 43 the bottom of the pipe. With either technique, the flame is directed almost, but not quite, to the centerline of the pipe. This angle may have to be changed slightly to control the molten “puddle” in the horizontal and overhead positions. The rod must rub in the bottom of the puddle, touching each side of the gap. As the rod is added to the puddle, the flame and rod should move in opposite directions with the flame directed at one side and the rod touching the other side in a “whipping” or U-shaped motion. The flame must be directed at the sides of the gap just long enough to ensure that the side metal is melted to allow fusion and complete penetration. Making a Rolling Weld Light the torch and set it for a neutral flame. Then, start about 2�down from the top (at the 1:30 position in Fig. 3-9) and, using a U-shaped motion with the torch tip, heat the area white hot. When the metal starts to melt, insert the welding rod and form a pool of molten metal. Add welding rod, keep- ing the end of the rod in the pool, and build the pool up to the top of the pipe. As the pipe is rolled clockwise (down), the tip should stay at the 1:30 position (Fig. 3-9), and you should use START WELD HERE END OF PIPE XII IX VI VIII VII XI X III IIII V I II Fig. 3-9 Starting a weld at the 1:30 position

Making a Position Weld A position weld is one that is made on a pipe that is station- ary, not rolled during the welding process. A position weld is the most difficult weld to make, yet job conditions often require that this type of weld be made. If the technique for making position welds is learned in the beginning, the welder can tackle any job with confidence. In making posi- tion welds, the welder must continually change torch angle and welding rod angle as the weld progresses around the pipe. The correct angles of the rod and torch in the various positions are shown in Fig. 3-10.

Tack weld a short piece, 18 or 20 in long, of 1⁄2 or 5⁄8-in steel rod to one end of the pipe; then place the other end of the rod in a vise (Fig. 3-11). ROD TACKED TO PIPE Fig. 3-11 Pipe supported in a vise, ready for position weld When you make this weld, start at the bottom (A in Fig. 3-10) and weld to the top (I) on one side. Then, go back to the bottom and weld to the top on the other side. Heat the welding rod about 8 in above one end and make a 90° bend. Play the flame on both pieces of pipe at A (Fig. 3-10) until the metal melts and starts to run down into the gap. Insert the short end of the welding rod at a 45° angle into the melted pool and build up the pool to the top of the metal. The pool will begin to run ahead of the flame, and the metal should be white hot and melting as the pool meets it. Make this practice weld in one pass, moving the welding rod and the torch tip in U-shaped motions, with the end of the rod and the tip at opposite ends of the U. This is a one-pass weld

The tip and rod angles will change, as shown in Fig. 3-10 as the different positions from A to I on each side are reached. As you learn to make position welds, you will get the feel for welding. After a practice position weld has been made, the weld can be cut out, and the pipe can be used again for practice. Table 3-1 shows the correct tip sizes, and oxygen and acetylene pressures for various metal thicknesses. The orifices in the cutting head should be cleaned often, using a tip cleaner (Fig. 3-12). Fig. 3-12 A welding tip cleaner Safety Precautions • Never allow oxygen under pressure to come in contact with oil, grease, dirt, or any type of organic material that may burn easily in high oxygen concentrations. • Never use an acetylene torch to blow off clothing. • Never use oxygen as a substitute for compressed air for testing purposes. • Never use acetylene at pressures in excess of 15 psig. • Always wear goggles of the correct shade when welding.

Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc 47 • Always wear gloves when welding. • When welding or cutting on jacketed or hollow parts, make certain that the parts are vented. • In many areas, safety rules require that another person work alongside a welder. The other person acts as an observer and prevents the starting of fires outside the welder’s line of vision.

48 Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) (Also Called “Stick” Welding) This section is designed to help the experienced welder perform the most difficult pipe weld, the 6G weld. Cir- cumferential arc welding of pipe in the 6G position, pipe sta- tionary at a 45° angle, is the most difficult task a welder faces. The American Welding Society designates welding positions from 1G through 6G. Most welding standards agree that a welder who can successfully complete a pipe test in the 6G position is qualified to weld pipe in all positions. As mentioned earlier, learning basic welding techniques requires hands-on training. Most welders learn to weld in apprenticeship programs, welding schools, or trade schools. Learning to make welds in all positions requires practicing correct procedures and techniques. The information pre- sented here is designed to help the reader advance from lower qualification ratings to a 6G qualification. Making a Position Weld A 6G position weld must be made to join two pieces of 6-in schedule 80 black steel pipe. The joint is in a pipe axis at a 45° angle, as shown in Fig. 3-13. The ends to be joined are beveled at a 37° angle with a 3⁄32-in root opening. The wall thickness of the pipe, 0.432 in, will require seven passes. The root pass will be made with 3⁄32-in diameter E6010 electrodes. The hot, or second, pass is followed by two fill passes, and the weld is finished by three cover passes, all deposited with 1⁄8-in diameter E7018 electrodes. In preparation for the weld, the pipe must be cleaned by using a wire brush to remove scale, rust, or oil to a distance 1 in back from the weld. The pipe can then be aligned in an angle or channel iron, as mentioned earlier, and tacked, leav- ing a 3⁄32-in gap for the root pass. Setting the Welding Current The weld will be made with the electrode positive and with the welding machine set to dc (direct current) at an acceptable

Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc 49 range. Voltage and amperage will vary from one machine to another; therefore, the welder should make a vertical test weld on a piece of scrap to determine the correct amperage setting. Making the Tack Welds The first step in joining is making the tack welds. Tack welds are part of the first pass. The tack welds should be 3⁄4 in in length and should be spaced 90° apart around the perimeter of the pipe. Fig. 3-13 shows the pipe in position for the weld. To ensure a good tie-in to the root pass, the edges of tacks should be ground to a feather edge. The Root Pass The bead sequence for welding pipe in the 6G position divides the pipe circumference into quadrants (Fig. 3-14) and requires the welder to start each quarter circle weld at the farthest location from where the previous bead ended.

To ensure good penetration of the root pass, the bead will be run uphill in all quadrants. Starting at A, the root pass of the first quadrant A to B is made. To avoid distortion of the pipe, the root pass in the second quadrant, D to C, is made next, followed by the third quadrant, A to D, and the fourth, B to C. Each quarter circle weld should start at the segment oppo- site to where the preceding weld segment ended, as seen in Fig. 3-14. The arc should be struck about 1 in in front of the point where the weld is to start. A long arc should be held until the electrode is dragged to the weld start point. At the starting point, the arc should be shortened to the correct length, 1⁄16 to 1⁄8 in. This method allows the welder to find the starting point and allows time to establish proper shielding-gas flow and arc characteristics. When welding the root pass, the cur- rent should be adjusted to maintain a keyhole (molten metal puddle) about 11⁄2 times the electrode diameter. If this keyhole is maintained, a good inside bead is formed with complete penetration. As the electrode moves forward in the joint, molten metal fills in behind the keyhole and forms the weld. To maintain the correct keyhole size, the welder adjusts arc current and weld travel speed. If the current is set

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc 51 too low, the keyhole becomes too large, causing an internal undercut or melt through. The welder should watch the molten puddle and the ridge of solidifying metal behind the arc. The ridge should form about 3⁄8 in behind the electrode. If weld travel is too fast, a thin, high-crowned bead will be formed. Stepping Technique When an E6010 electrode is used for the root pass, the welder steps the electrode in the joint using wrist action to move the electrode forward about 11⁄2 times its diameter, then returns it to the puddle. This process is repeated along the joint. The change in electrode angle and technique that occurs as the weld moves forward and upward must be gradual. Penetration will be incomplete if the welding is done with the electrode (rod) at too low an angle or at excessive travel speed. Penetration can be increased by increasing the rod angle or decreasing travel speed. To maintain uniform and proper root penetration, the electrode should be held at a 90° angle to the pipe circumference when starting the weld (Fig. 3-15). As the electrode is moved forward in making the root pass, the welder will change the angle of the electrode slightly, plus or minus 5°, to maintain the “puddle” in front of or behind the arc. The change in angle is called a “leading angle” or a “trailing angle.” When welding above the 4 o’clock and 8 o’clock posi- tions, the electrode should not exceed a 5° trailing angle. Any time the root pass is stopped, the welder should push the electrode through the keyhole about 1/2 in, extinguish the arc, and withdraw the electrode. This procedure helps main- tain full root penetration at tie-ins. After welding each seg- ment, a grinder should be used to feather the ends of the bead. When the final quadrant of the root pass is completed at the top of the pass, the weld must be cleaned. A chipping hammer and a wire brush should be used to remove the slag. Using a die grinder to form the root pass into a U shape will help ensure that on subsequent passes the electrode will touch bottom all the way around the joint. After grinding,

If this residue is not removed, it will mix with the molten metal on the next pass and contaminate the weld. The Hot Pass The second, or “hot pass,” will require a current setting slightly higher than was used for the root pass. The hot pass must have enough current to burn out impurities in the root pass, while at the same time not be so high as to cause the electrode coating to break down or burn through the root pass. A side-to-side weave motion, not exceeding three times the welding rod diameter, will provide full bead width.

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc 53 At the start of the root pass, the electrode was held at a 90° angle to the weld; for the hot pass and all subsequent passes, the electrode should be angled slightly to allow for complete penetration into the previous pass and to the pipe wall. Slag must be removed from every pass, using a wire brush and chipping hammer. If there is a visible flaw, the flawed area should be ground out and the residue from the grinder removed. The Fill Passes When the two fill passes are made, the first fill pass should be made on the low side of the joint and the second pass on the high side. A slight oscillating, or up-and-down, motion of the electrode allows the molten weld metal to penetrate into both the previous pass and the side of the pipe wall. Each pass should be carefully checked for undercut and weld porosity. The Cover Passes Each cover pass begins on the low side of the joint using the oscillating technique that was used on the fill passes. Each quadrant is welded until the weld surrounds the pipe. After the first pass is cleaned, the second pass is made, penetrating equally into the first cover pass and into the fill pass below. After the second cover pass is cleaned, the third cover pass is made. This pass should fill the remaining gap. If the entire gap cannot be filled with the third pass another pass will be needed. When the welder grinds to remove high spots on the fin- ished weld, the abrasive should be run across the weld, not along the weld. In an x-ray, parallel grinding marks could be mistaken for flaws in the weld. Safety Precautions • A welder and anyone watching a welding procedure must use a welding helmet equipped with the proper shaded lens for adequate eye protection. Shaded lenses in the range of 12 to 14 are suggested.

54 Pipe Welding with Oxyacetylene and Arc • Before operating a welding machine, check to be cer- tain that the machine is properly grounded. • The area where welding is being done should be so enclosed that the arc is not visible outside this area. • Heavy leather gauntlet type gloves should be worn while welding. Never weld while wearing wet gloves or wet shoes. • Keep the working area clean; pick up electrode stubs, scrap metal, and so on. • Never weld on closed containers or on containers that have contained combustible materials. • Welding inside tanks, boilers, or other confined spaces requires special procedures such as using a hose mask or air-supplied hood. Oxygen depletion when working in a confined space or vessel can have fatal results. • Welding or cutting galvanized materials is very dan- gerous because of the fumes released by burning zinc. High-velocity fans should be so placed that the fumes are blown away from the welder and the area is well ventilated to protect other personnel in the room, building, or vicinity. More complete information on health protection and venti- lation can be found in the American Standard Z.49.1 “Safety in Welding and Cutting.” This document is available from: The American Welding Society P.O.

55 4. AUTOMATIC FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEMS Sprinkler fitting is a very specialized branch of the piping trade. Sprinkler fitters serve an apprenticeship during which they learn the various codes and standards that apply to fire protection installations. The tools and machinery used by sprinkler fitters are common to other branches of the piping trades. The scope of work involved includes installing water mains to serve sprinkler systems; installation of piping from mains to and including individual piping systems; installa- tion and servicing of valves, air compressors, and foam gen- erators; and regular maintenance, testing, and servicing of various types of automatic fire protection equipment. A sprinkler system designed for fire protection is an inte- grated system of underground and overhead piping that includes one or more automatically controlled water supplies. The portion of the sprinkler system located above ground is a network of specially sized or hydraulically designed piping installed in a building, structure, or area, generally overhead, to which sprinkler heads are attached in a systematic pattern. The valve controlling each system riser is located in the riser or its supply piping. Each sprinkler riser includes a device for actuating an alarm if the system is activated. Normally activated by heat from a fire, the system dis- charges water over the fire area through sprinkler heads. A typical sprinkler head is shown in Fig. 4-1. Sprinkler systems can be classified into two main types: 1. Wet-pipe systems 2. Dry-pipe systems Further variations of these systems are: 1. Preaction systems 2. Deluge systems 3. Combined dry-pipe and preaction systems

56 Automatic Fire Protection Systems Wet-Pipe System A wet-pipe sprinkler system is fixed fire protection using piping filled with pressurized water and activated by fusible sprinklers for the control of fire. A wet-pipe sprinkler system may be installed in any struc- ture not subject to freezing temperatures. The system will auto- matically protect the structure, contents, and/or personnel from loss or harm due to fire. However, the structure must be sub- stantial enough to support the piping system filled with water. Operation of a Wet-Pipe System When a fire occurs, the heat produced will fuse (open) a sprin- kler head and cause water to flow. The alarm valve clapper is opened by the flow and allows pressurized water to fill the retarding chamber. The flow overcomes the retarding cham- ber’s small capacity drain and fills the alarm line. This in turn closes the pressure switch, sounds an electric alarm, and acti- vates the mechanical water motor alarm. If a water-flow indi- cator is used in the system piping, it also is activated by the water flow.

58 Automatic Fire Protection Systems the fusible sprinkler heads is filled with pressurized air or nitrogen instead of water. An air-check system is a small dry system that is directly connected to a wet-pipe system. The air check system uses a dry valve and an air supply but does not have a separate alarm. The alarm is provided by the main alarm valve. Although the system is weighs less than the wet-pipe system, the structure housing a dry-pipe system must, nevertheless, be substantial enough to support the system piping when the system is filled with water. Operation of a Dry-Pipe System The components of a dry-pipe system are shown in Fig. 4-3. These components may vary somewhat due to the applica- tion of different sets of standards. The system shown in Fig. 4-3 is only one possible arrangement of a dry-pipe sys- tem. Additional components of a dry-pipe system are an ade- quate supply of water taken from a city main, an elevated storage tank, or a ground storage reservoir with an adequate pumping system. Underground System 1. Piping. Cast iron, ductile iron, cement asbestos, and (where permitted) PVC Schedule 40. 2. Control valves, post indicator valves (PIV). 3. Valve pit; usually required when multiple sprinkler systems are serviced from a common underground sys- tem taking water supply from a city main. The pit will contain: O.S. & Y. (open stem and yoke) valves; check valves or detector check, fire department connection; a 21⁄2 in. �21⁄2 in. �4 in. hose connection; 4 in. check valves with ball drip (backflow preventer). 4.

60 Automatic Fire Protection Systems Deluge Systems A deluge system is an empty-pipe system that is used in high- hazard areas or in areas where fire may spread quickly. It can also be used to cool surfaces such as tanks, process piping lines, or transformers. In this type of application, open sprin- klers or spray nozzles are employed for water distribution. The deluge valve is activated by a release system employing one or more of the following methods: manual, fixed tem- perature, rate of temperature rise, radiation, smoke or com- bustion gases, hazardous vapors, or temperature increase. Once a deluge system is activated, water or other extinguish- ing agents flow through all spray nozzles and/or sprinkler heads simultaneously. Two typical applications of deluge sys- tems are flammable liquid loading facilities and aircraft hangars. Flammable Liquid Loading Facilities Truck and rail loading facilities for flammable or com- bustible liquids routinely handle large volumes of potentially dangerous materials in complete safety. Vehicles may, however, collide or hit the loading structure, rupturing tanks or pipes. Hoses, nozzles, or valves that are in constant use may break or malfunction, and operator error is always a hazard. Any of these failures could result in a spill, which, if ignited, could cause a disastrous fire. Because large volumes of fuel are present, it is likely that a fire would develop rapidly and endanger personnel, vehicles, cargoes, and the unprotected loading structure. The loading site is almost always curbed or otherwise contained because it is not usually permissible to wash the fire to another area. For that reason, the fire must be quickly extinguished and not allowed to reflash. Control Strategy A widely used and economical way to handle the hazard is a foam-water deluge sprinkler system. The structure and the upper portion of the vehicles are kept cool by a water spray, but because water alone is not effective in the extinguishing

Because a fire may be expected to develop very quickly, combination rate-of-rise and fixed-temperature detectors are normally employed. Backup manual activation should also be provided. Pipe lines carrying flammable liquid or fuel to the loading area may be equipped with shutoff valves, which are auto- matically closed when the fire detectors operate. Pumps associated with this system may also be interlocked to shut off. When the detection system operates, the deluge valve opens and supplies water to the sprinkler piping. Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) concentrate is introduced into the water by the proportioner and is mixed in the sprinkler pip- ing. Unsealed upright sprinklers provide for the structure, the top of the vehicles, and the surrounding area. Unsealed sprinklers located on the lower structure deliver foam to the underside of the vehicle and over the ground below. Hand- held hose lines controlled by manual valves are also fed from the sprinkler piping. Water flow alarms sound when the sprin- kler piping is flooded. Flammable liquid supply may be stopped by pump shutdown or by an automatic shutoff valve actuated by a pressure switch in the sprinkler piping. The components of a fire protection system for liquid load- ing facilities are shown in Fig. 4-4. Protein foam may be used in place of AFFF. If protein foam is used, special foam-water sprinklers must replace standard open sprinklers. If large quantities of water and foam concentrate are required, pumps that are started by a signal from the detection system are usually employed for both liquids. Flow-control valves with downstream pressure regulators may be used in place of deluge valves to conserve water and foam concentrate. In the event that release is in a freezing area, a pneumatic release system must be used and a suitable air supply pro- vided. Electrical fixed-temperature and rate-of-temperature-rise

Infrared or ultraviolet detection may also be used, but consideration must be given to the increased potential for false trips. Aircraft Hangar Fire Protection Today’s huge aircraft hangar represents a large and concen- trated loss potential. The primary hazard is the ignition of a fuel spill involving an aircraft located in the hangar. An air- craft is extremely vulnerable to heat sources producing skin temperatures above 400°F (250°C). The hangar itself is sus- ceptible to fire damage, because usual construction includes an unprotected steel-supported roof, which will buckle and possibly collapse when exposed to high temperatures. A schematic drawing of an aircraft hangar fire protection sys- tem is shown in Fig. 4-5.

Automatic Fire Protection Systems 63 Control Strategy Rapid control and extinguishing of fire is vital if loss is to be minimized. Even when it is not possible to save an aircraft, it is necessary to control and extinguish the fire to protect the hangar. Because buoyant flammable liquid is the principal fire hazard, extinguishing systems employing a foam-water agent are the preferred means of protection. The aircraft and the building structure are cooled by the water, while the burning fuel is smothered by the foam. Water alone generally means higher density requirements, resulting in higher costs and lower efficiency. Three types of extinguishing systems are normally pro- vided for complete coverage, all employing foam. First, a monitor nozzle system, automatically activated by high-sen- sitivity optical detectors, is used to protect the underside of the aircraft. An in-floor sprinkler head and piping is shown in Fig. 4-6. This sprinkler head in operation is shown in Fig. 4-7.

This foam-water system provides building protection in the event that the monitor nozzle system fails to control a fire. Third, hand-held hose lines with foam nozzles are pro- vided for manual firefighting operations. Because building protection is provided by a deluge system, large amounts of water and foam concentrate are required. These must be properly managed to avoid exhausting the supply. Pumping facilities are nearly always required to meet high volume demands. Fig. 4-6 A Viking in-floor sprinkler head and piping under floor grate

Automatic Fire Protection Systems 65 Operation of a Foam-Water Deluge System Initial detection is normally accomplished by the monitor detection system, employing either infrared or ultraviolet detectors. These systems are capable of detecting a fire in its early stages. However, false trips are a possibility with such detection systems and must be seriously considered. Manual activation of the monitor system is also provided. In a typical system actuation, a signal from the monitor detector is received by the release control panel (which may be interlocked to the foam and water concentrate supply pump starters). This signal opens both flow control valves supplying water and foam to the monitor nozzles and sounds an alarm. Foam concentrate is proportioned into the water and mixed in the supply piping. The flow-control valve operates both as a deluge valve and as a downstream pressure-regulating valve to ensure the correct proportion of water and foam concentrate regardless of varying supply pressure. The monitor nozzles move in a programmed path to cover the aircraft, the under- aircraft areas, and areas that might contain a fuel spill. Hose Fig. 4-7 An in-floor sprinkler head in operation

66 Automatic Fire Protection Systems lines supplied by individual manual valves are located at con- venient places for manual firefighting. In the event the monitor nozzles do not control the fire, the temperature will increase at the roof. This condition will trigger a release, which is activated by either fixed-tempera- ture or rate-of-temperature-rise conditions, causing the flow- control valve to open. Unsealed, upright sprinklers then distribute the foam over the general area. The operation of the roof system will trip the monitor system in the event that it has not already functioned. That operation may also be designed to actuate systems in adjacent areas. Protein or fluoroprotein foam may be used in place of AFFF. If such foam is used, special foam-water sprinklers must also be used in place of standard open sprinklers. In the event that the release is in a freezing area, pneumatic opera- tion must be used and a suitable air supply must be provided. Electrical fixed-temperature and rate-of-temperature-rise detection, utilizing a release control panel, may be used in place of mechanical detection at the hangar roof. Standard practice in most areas is to use Schedule 40 black steel pipe and threaded black cast iron fittings for mains and branch piping. 21⁄2 in I.D. (inside diameter) and larger valves and fittings are usually flanged and joined to threaded pipe by companion flanges. Backflow Preventers When fire protection systems are connected to potable water supplies, check valves are required in the system piping to prevent backflow of potentially polluted water into the potable water system. When fire department pumper trucks arrive at a fire, they immediately connect a hose to the near- est fire hydrant. A hose may, if needed, be connected from the truck’s pump to the fire department’s Siamese connection (Figs. 4-2 and 4-3). Water is drawn from the hydrant, and if higher pressure is needed, the pumper truck can pump water into the fire protection system piping. The pumper truck is capable of building pressure in excess of water main pressure

A backflow preventer is designed to prevent the reversed flow of water of nonpotable quality from being pumped or siphoned into the potable water line. A double-check backflow preventer is shown in Fig. 4-8. Fig.4-8 A double-check backflow preventer (Courtesy Watts Regulator) Black steel pipe, grooved or threaded with grooved or threaded fittings, is usually used for sprinkler piping.

68 5. STEAM HEATING SYSTEMS A typical steam boiler with all essential controls and safety devices is shown in Fig. 5-1. To be efficient in producing steam, a boiler must be clean; oils, greases, pipe dopes, or other contaminating materials present in the boiler and pip- ing must be purged. To accomplish this, the boiler must be filled to normal water level with water to which caustic soda or another suitable cleaning agent has been added. The boiler must then be brought up to steaming temperature, the drain connection opened, and the dirty water piped to a suit- able drain. Water must be added during this process to replace the water drained out. The time needed to purge the boiler and piping depends on the boiler’s size. All steam heating systems are one of two basic types: one-pipe or two-pipe systems. A one-pipe system uses one pipe to deliver steam to a unit and to return the condensate from the unit. There are variations of these two systems. In a parallel-flow system, both steam and condensate flow in the same direction (Fig. 5-2). When the steam flows in one direction and the condensate returns against the steam flow, the system is then called a counterflow system (Fig. 5-3.) The heating unit has only one connection, and steam enters the unit while condensate is returning through the same connection. The correct pitch or slope of piping for proper operation of a gravity flow system is essential to ensure the flow of steam, air, and condensate. The correct pitch or slope for a gravity flow system is not less than 1 inch in 20 feet. A one-pipe system is very dependable, and the initial installation cost is low. Air vents are used on each individual heating unit and at the ends of steam mains. Steam must enter the heating unit at the bottom inlet tap- ping of the unit, and because steam must enter and conden- sate return through the valve at the same time, an angle pattern valve should be used at this point. A straightway

horizontal valve would offer an obstruction to the free flow of steam and condensate. A radiator supply valve on a one- pipe system cannot be used as a throttling valve; the valve must be either full on or full off. If the valves on this type system were used as throttling valves, condensate could not return to the boiler and noise would be created. The correct valve for use in a one-pipe steam system is shown in Fig. 5-4. Air present in the piping of a one-pipe system must be elimi- nated in order for steam to flow. An end-of-main vent should be installed near, but not at, the end of the steam main. The right location for this vent is shown in Fig. 5-5(A). If this valve is not installed correctly, the float can be damaged by Steam Heating Systems 69 COLD WATER SAFETY VALVE REDUCING ELBOW BOILER WATER LEVEL CLOSE NIPPLE DRAIN RETURN MAIN HOSE GATE VALVE GATE VALVES GLOBE VALVES STEAM SUPPLY LINES TO SYSTEM GATE VALVE STRAINER CHECK VALVE PLUGGED TEES AND CROSSES GAUGE GLASS MECHANICAL FLOAT-ACTUATED FEEDER WITH LOW-WATER CUTOFF DRAIN VALVES FASTEN TO BOILER BASE NOTE: INSTALL BOILER WATER FEEDER WITH CLOSING LEVEL 2″ MIN.

As a result, an air vent must be installed in the vent tapping on the side opposite the supply valve. There are two types of air vents: the open (nonvacuum) type, which has a single nonadjustable port, and the adjustable-port vacuum vent used for proportional venting.

This condensate is joined by the con- densate formed in various units of radiation and returns to the boiler through the return piping. The section of piping between the end of the supply main and the end-of-main vent is called the dry return. The dry return also carries steam and air. It is that portion of the return main which is located above the boiler water line. That portion of the return main that is below the boiler water line is called a wet return, (see Fig. 5-17 later in this chapter). A wet return is also shown in Fig. 5-7; a dry return is not shown here because the dimensions shown are used only in designing a steam heating system. In both the wet and dry return systems, dimension “A” in Fig. 5-7 must be maintained.

Hartford Loop A Hartford loop (Fig. 5-2) is a pressure-balancing loop that introduces full boiler pressure on the return side of the boiler. Without this loop, reversed circulation could occur, allowing water to leave the boiler via the return piping. It is the only safe method of preventing reversed circulation. The Hartford loop must be the full size of the return main, and the horizontal nip- ple at the return connection point should be 2 in below the boiler water line. A close nipple should be used to construct the Hartford loop. If a longer nipple is used, water hammer noise will be created. Water hammer is a wave transmitted through a pipe filled or partially filled with water. The rapid passage of steam over the surface of the water causes a wave to form. When this wave slams against another pocket of water or the float of a vent valve, the hammering noise is created. System Pressures—Designing a Steam Heating System A small system with a total heat loss of not more than 100,000 Btu/hr (British thermal unit/hour) is sized on the basis of 1⁄8 psig (pounds per square inch gauge) The three Steam Heating Systems 73 STEAM SUPPLY MAIN SAFETY FACTOR FLOW TOTAL PRESSURE DROP BOILER WATER LINE WET RETURN BOILER PRESSURE DROP OF SYSTEM STATIC HEAD "A" Fig. 5-7 Measuring pressure drop, static head, and safety factors

74 Steam Heating Systems distances for the pressure drop, the static head, and the safety factor in Fig. 5-7 will be: Pressure drop of system (1⁄8 psig) �31⁄2 in of water Static head (friction of wet return) �31⁄2 in of water Safety factor (twice the static head) �7 in of water Total distance �14 in of water It is standard practice to make distance “A” in small sys- tems not less than 18 in. For a larger system, assume that the piping is sized for a pressure drop of 1⁄2 psi. The three distances shown in Fig. 5-7 would then be: Pressure drop of system (1⁄2 psig) �14 in of water Static head (friction of wet return) �4 in of water Safety factor (twice the static head) �8 in of water Total distance �26 in of water It is standard practice to make minimum dimension “A” for a system based on 1⁄2-in pressure drop not less than 28 in. To explain the previous figures: Figure 5-7 shows that water in the wet return is really in an inverted siphon with the boiler steam pressure on top of the water at the boiler end and steam main pressure on top of the water at the other end. The difference between these two pressures is the pressure drop in the system. The pressure drop is the loss due to friction of the steam passing from the boiler to the far end of the steam main. The water at the far end will rise sufficiently to overcome this difference in order to balance the pressures, and it will rise enough, usually about 3 in, to produce a flow through the return into the boiler. If a one-pipe system is designed for a total pressure drop of 1⁄2 psi and a Hartford loop is used on the return, the rise in the water level at the far end of the return, due to the differ- ence in steam pressure, will be 1⁄2 of 28 in, or 14 in. Adding 3 in to this for the flow through the return main and 6 in for

a safety factor gives 23 in as the distance by which the bot- tom of the lowest part of the steam main and all heating units must be above the boiler water level. Higher pressure drops would increase the distance accordingly. More on Parallel-Flow Systems A one-pipe parallel-flow upfeed system is designed for build- ings that have more than one floor. With this system, steam is distributed to various units of radiation through a base- ment main from which upfeed risers feed the second and third floors. The upfeed risers are dripped back to the return main. The risers should be connected as shown in Fig. 5-8 to keep the horizontal main free of condensate accumulation and to ensure the unobstructed flow of steam. A parallel- flow downfeed system has the distribution main installed above the heating units (Fig. 5-9). With this type of system, steam and condensate flow in the same direction in the downfeed risers. The main steam supply riser should be installed directly from the boiler to the overhead supply mains. The downfeed runout connections are taken from the bottom of the horizontal supply main to ensure the least accumulation of condensate in the main.

76 Steam Heating Systems Condensate Pumps When there is insufficient height to maintain minimum dimension “A” (Fig. 5-7) a condensate pump must be used to return condensate to the boiler. When a condensate pump is used, the boiler pressure, the end of the steam main pres- sure, and the boiler water line elevation have no bearing on the height of the end of the steam main as long as it is above the maximum water level in the condensate pump receiver. The return piping must be pitched to eliminate pockets that would trap air and prevent gravity flow of condensate to the receiver. The pump discharge is connected directly to the boiler return opening without the use of a Hartford loop. A Hartford loop connection can cause noise when used with a pumped discharge of condensate. Correct installation of an aboveground condensate receiver and pump is shown in Fig. 5-10. The correct way to install an underground receiver and pump is shown in Fig. 5-11. Solving Problems on the Job Fig. 5-12 shows the correct way to run steam and conden- sate piping around a beam.

Two-Pipe Heating Systems A two-pipe heating system is a system in which the heating units have two connections, one for the steam supply the other for condensate return. The return main begins at the discharge of a float and thermostatic trap as shown in Fig. 5-17. This trap is sized to handle the entire maximum condensate load of a sin- gle main or the connected load of individual mains. Some of the components used in one-pipe systems are also used in two- pipe systems. Two-pipe systems are designed to operate at pressures ranging from subatmospheric (vacuum) to high pres- sure. Condensate may be returned to the boiler by gravity flow or by the use of pumps or other mechanical return devices.

Thermostatic traps open in response to pressure as well as temperature in order to discharge condensate and air. When steam reaches the thermostatic element, the trap closes to prevent the discharge of steam into the return piping. A float and thermostatic trap (Figure 5-19) is opened by condensate collecting in the trap and raising the float. As the float is raised, it opens the discharge port allowing conden- sate to enter the return piping. When air or condensate is present in the trap at a temperature below its designed clos- ing pressure, the thermostatic air bypass remains open. The thermostatic air bypass closes as steam enters the trap. Several different types of traps are used in two-pipe steam heating systems. Some include float and thermostatic traps, float traps, inverted bucket traps, and open bucket traps. Supply valves used with a two-pipe system are globe valves, either the angle or straight type. Modulating (adjustable flow) or nonmodulating types can be used. A packless valve (Fig. 5-20) is best suited for use in two-pipe vacuum systems

If the water level is too high, inefficient opera- tion results. If it is too low, the boiler may be permanently dam- aged or an explosion could occur. A boiler low-water cutoff or a combination boiler-water feeder and low-water cutoff (Fig. 5-21) is designed to automatically shut down power to a boiler in the event of a low water condition. Try cocks (Fig. 5-22) are installed on steam boilers at the safe high water level and at the safe low water level to provide for manual checking of the water level. The correct way to open a try cock is shown in Fig. 5-23.

Therefore, 28.21 cubic feet of steam at atmospheric pressure weighs 1 pound, and 12.387 cubic feet of air weighs one pound. • Each nominal horsepower of boilers requires from 4 to 6 gallons of water per hour.

84 Steam Heating Systems • Good boilers will evaporate from 10 to 12 pounds of water per pound of coal. • One square foot of grate surface will consume from 10 to 12 pounds of hard coal or from 18 to 20 pounds of soft coal per hour with natural draft. With forced drafts these amounts can be doubled. • In calculating the horsepower of boilers, allow about 111⁄2 square feet of heating surface per horsepower. • The standard unit of the horsepower of boilers (1915 Power Test Code, A.S.M.E.) is: One boiler horsepower is equivalent to the evaporation, from 212°F. feed water, of 341⁄2 pounds of water into dry saturated steam at 212°. • Steam at a given temperature is said to be saturated when it is of maximum density for that temperature. Steam in contact with water is saturated steam. • Steam that has water in the form of small drops sus- pended in it is called “wet,” or supersaturated, steam. If wet steam is heated until all the water sus- pended in it is evaporated, it is said to be “dry” steam. • If dry saturated steam is heated when not in contact with water, its temperature is raised and its density is diminished or its pressure is raised. The steam is then said to be “superheated.” Linear Expansion of Piping Piping carrying steam or hot water will expand or lengthen in direct relation to the temperature of the steam or hot water.

86 6. HOT-WATER HEATING SYSTEMS A hot-water heating system consists of a coal-, oil-, or gas- fired boiler, an expansion tank, boiler controls, piping, radiation, temperature controls, valves, air vents, and circu- lating pumps if needed. Hot-water heating systems or combi- nation heating and cooling systems are called “hydronic systems.” Hot-water heating systems vary from simple one- pipe gravity systems to two-pipe reverse-return systems. Boilers for hot-water heating systems are designed to oper- ate at pressures not to exceed 30 psig. Two types of boilers are used: cast-iron sectional boilers and steel tubular boilers. Cast iron boilers are made with front and back sections and one or more intermediate sections. The sections are assembled on the job and are joined together by tapered nip- ples at the top and bottom. When a sectional boiler is being assembled, extreme care must be taken to start the nipples straight. The sections are pulled together and held in place by steel rods inserted through an end section, then through intermediate sections, and through the other end section. Nuts and washers on each end of the rods must be tightened evenly as the sections are pulled together. The cold-water inlet is at the bottom of the rear-end section. The hot-water outlet is usually at the top of a center section. Tappings are provided in the sections for the installation of controls. Modern boilers usually are equipped with a jacket installed after the boiler is installed. Older boilers may be insulated on the job and finished with a fabric coating. Steel boilers are often delivered to the job site as a “pack- age” with an insulated jacket and many controls and acces- sories installed. Large steel boilers are usually delivered as a bare unit, and all controls and accessories must be installed on the job. A refractory chamber must be built in the boiler for the firing method used. After all controls and accessories are installed, the boiler is insulated and a jacket is installed.

Hot-Water Heating Systems 87 Expansion Tank A compression tank, more often called an “expansion tank,” (Fig. 6-1) must be installed in a hot-water heating system in order for the system to work properly. When water is heated, it expands, and in expanding, pressure is created. Water is virtually incompressible, so space must be provided to allow for the expansion of the heated water. The expansion tank provides this space. The tank shown in Fig. 6-1 is con- nected to an air scoop. As water in the system flows through the scoop, the scoop separates air present in the system from the water, and the automatic air vent on top of the scoop releases this air. Although the expansion tank can be connected in sev- eral ways, the preferred method is to connect the tank to a tapping provided in an air separator. In normal opera- tion, an expansion tank will be from 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 full of water. The air cushion in an expansion tank allows for the expansion and compression created when the water in the system is heated. If the tank is not air- tight, air leaking from the tank will be displaced by water, leaving no space to allow for expansion-created pressure. An expansion tank filled with water is said to be “water- logged.” If an expansion tank Fig. 6-1 An expansion tank, air scoop, and air vent used with hot-water heating systems (Courtesy Watts Regulator)

88 Hot-Water Heating Systems becomes waterlogged without an air cushion, there is no room for expansion as the water in the system is heated. Pressure created by the expansion of the heated water will cause the relief valve to open and relieve the increased pres- sure. The expansion tank must be sized for the volume of water in the heating system. It is generally located in an area above the boiler. A combination pressure, temperature, and altitude gauge must be installed on a hot-water boiler in order to check operating pressure and temperature. Air Control Air control is absolutely essential in operation of hydronic systems. The air in an expansion tank should be the only air present in a hydronic system. But, water will absorb air, so a means must be provided to separate air present in the water and return it to the expansion tank. The air separator shown in Fig. 6-2. is made to be mounted on end- or side- outlet boilers. An inline air separator is shown in Fig. 6-3. The flanged air separator shown in Fig. 6-4 is designed for large heating/cooling systems. The air separator shown in Fig. 6-5 is made for mounting on an expansion tank. It is designed to restrict the flow of water from the tank without restricting the flow of free air into the tank.

90 Hot-Water Heating Systems Fig. 6-5 A tank fitting that separates air from water (Courtesy of Bell & Gossett) shown in Fig. 6-6 is made for use in top-outlet boilers. Air is separated in the fitting and is directed to the expansion tank through the side outlet of the separator. Air in the piping system can cause noise and can also interfere with water circulation. When a new hot-water heat- ing system is started up, or after a system has been drained, the water entering the system will force air to the high points. Air must be removed from high points in piping and from radiation to allow water to circulate through the sys- tem. This is accomplished by use of air vents installed on piping and radiation. Three types of air vents are shown in Fig. 6-7. Relief Valves If an expansion tank becomes waterlogged or if a runaway firing condition should occur because of failure of controls, expansion and pressure could create a dangerous situation.

Hot-Water Heating Systems 91 designed to open at 30 psi must be installed on every boiler. An ASME/AGA approved relief valve for use on boilers is shown in Fig. 6-8. System Operating Controls Safety codes require that two aquastats be installed on every hot-water heating boiler. One aquastat serves as the operat- ing control, controlling the boiler water temperature, the other as a high-limit con- trol. The operating control (aquastat) is a normally open thermally activated electri- cal switch that closes (makes contact) on temperature fall of the boiler water. When the switch closes, the gas or oil burner is energized, turning the burner on. When the boiler water reaches the set tempera- ture, the aquastat switch opens, breaking electrical contact, and the burner is turned off. The high-limit control is a normally closed electrical switch that opens, break- ing electrical contact if the boiler water temperature exceeds the set temperature of the high-limit control. Normal prac- tice is to set the high-limit control 10° above the operating control. Operating and high-limit aquastats are shown in Fig. 6-9. Both the operating aquastat and the high-limit aquastat are wired in series with the gas or oil burner controls. If either of the aquastats “opens,” electrical contact with the gas or oil controls is broken and, providing the controls are wired correctly, the gas or oil burner will be shut off. The gas or oil controls can vary from simple solenoid valves to electronic and/or pneumatic con- trols, which require technicians to maintain and service them.

92 Hot-Water Heating Systems Boiler operating temperatures can also be controlled by sensing devices installed outside a building. When this sys- tem is used, a rise in outside temperature will lower the boiler water temperature; a drop in outside temperature will raise the boiler water temperature. Circulating Pumps Circulating pumps are used to force circulation of water through the piping system. In one type of system, water (A) MANUALLY OPERATED AIR VENT (B) MANUAL AND/OR AUTOMATIC AIR VENT (C) AUTOMATIC AIR VENT Fig. 6-7 Three types of manual and automatic air vents (Courtesy of Bell & Gossett)

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

circulates constantly, and tempera- tures of a floor, room, or area are controlled by electrically or pneu- matically operated valves mounted on radiation and actuated by ther- mostats. Temperatures in a room, floor, or area can also be controlled by a thermostat that electrically energizes a circulating pump, turning the pump on or off as temperatures rise or fall. This is called a “zoned” sys- tem; each room, floor, or area is a zone with an individual run of pip- ing with its own circulating pump. An inline circulating pump is shown in Fig. 6-10. This type pump is normally used on small heating sys- tems. The pump shown in Fig. 6-11 is designed for larger systems. Many of these type pumps are high-velocity pumps that will force water through the system, pushing air ahead of the water, in some cases eliminating the need for air vents in the piping. Boiler Water Feeders Water is introduced into a heating system automatically by a valve of the type shown in Fig. 6-12. Given the fact that all water contains air, air in a heating system will rise to the highest point in the system. When a hot-water radiator does not get hot, it indicates that air is present in the radiator. When the air is bled off through the air vent, water enters the radiator replacing the discharged air. This causes a momen- tary drop in pressure, and water will enter the system through the automatic water feeder. Hot-water heating systems are used for many purposes. Hot-water heat is used for radiant heat in floors and ceilings. Hot-Water Heating Systems 93 Fig. 6-8 An ASME/ AGA boiler-water safety relief valve (Courtesy Watts Regulator)

Hot-Water Heating Systems 95 Hot-water systems using antifreeze solutions are used for melting snow and ice on sidewalks, parking garages, and other areas frequented by the public. Whereas the water in a steam boiler must be free from grease or oil to allow the water to boil, oil or grease in a hot- water boiler does not affect its operating efficiency. Hot-water heating systems where the water is heated by steam through a heat exchanger are often used in conjunction Fig. 6-11 A base-mounted circulating pump (Courtesy of Bell & Gossett) Fig. 6-12 An automatic boiler water feeder (Courtesy Watts Regulator)

Thermostats Although most thermostats are electric low-voltage types, schools, public buildings, and many offices use pneumatic temperature control systems with pneumatically operated thermostats. It is apparent in every office building that the personal tastes of every worker vary as to the setting of ther- mostats. In public buildings, it is common practice to install tamperproof covers over thermostats. A thermostat that is 96 Hot-Water Heating Systems with a steam heating system. A word of warning here: The correct type and size of ASME/AGA-rated relief valve must always be installed on this type of hot-water heating system. Balancing a Hot-Water Heating System A correctly sized hot-water heating system will heat every area in a building if the flow is evenly distributed to each piece of radiation. One problem often encountered is that the first three or four radiators on a piping run heat, while the last two or three remain cold. The first three or four radiators are taking all the heat from the supply; therefore, the flow through these radiators must be restricted to allow hot water to reach the remaining radiators. Balancing cocks (Fig. 6-13) installed on the return side of each radiator and adjusted correctly will solve this problem.

Hot-Water Heating Systems 97 adjusted correctly will anticipate heating or cooling settings and regulate the temperatures accordingly. Three Types of Piping Systems for Hot-Water Heat One-Pipe Forced-Circulation Systems A typical one-pipe forced-circulation hot-water heating sys- tem is shown in Fig. 6-14. When this type system is used, there are several ways to force circulation through each piece of radiation. The two most common ways are to use reduc- ing tees on the inlet and outlet connections to each radiator or to use flow fittings at the inlet connections. 11⁄4 × 1 × 1⁄2 tees 11⁄4 × 1 × 1⁄2 tees T P 11⁄4 × 1 × 1⁄2 tees 11⁄4 × 1 × 1⁄2 tees 1″ 1″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 1″ 1″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 11⁄4″ 1″ 1″ 1″ 1″ Fig. 6-14 A one-pipe system using reducing tees

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

98 Hot-Water Heating Systems Example Using Reducing Tees Assuming the one-pipe system to be 11⁄4-in pipe, the inlet tee supplying the first radiator would be a 11⁄4 in �1 in �1⁄2 in tee. The pipe between the inlet tee and the outlet tee from the first radiator would be 1 in. The outlet tee would be a 11⁄4 in �1 in �1⁄2 in tee. The main would continue as 11⁄4 in. The reduction in main size between the two tees forces circula- tion through the radiator. This system is shown in Fig. 6-14. Example Using Monoflo Fittings Again assuming the one-pipe system to be 11⁄4-in pipe, Monoflo fittings are made to be used as either upflow or downflow fittings. The built-in diverters in the Monoflo fit- tings serve as restrictors to force flow through the radiators. As shown in Fig. 6-15, the Monoflo fittings should be ONE FITTING INSTALLATION– The "RING" trademark goes between the risers; the Return arrow points in the direction of flow. TWO FITTING INSTALLATION– The Monoflo Fitting is used for both Supply and Return. The "RING" trademarks are between the risers; used in high pressure drop radiation or when radiation is below the main.

installed with the “ring” between the risers. On a one-fitting installation, the fitting would be installed on the return con- nection to the main with the arrow pointing in the direction of flow. When two Monoflo fittings are installed, the “ring” end should be between the risers. Two-Pipe Direct-Return System In a two-pipe direct-return system (Fig. 6-16) the supply main begins at the first radiator, the one closest to the boiler, Hot-Water Heating Systems 99 T P Fig. 6-16 A two-pipe direct-return hot-water heating system

100 Hot-Water Heating Systems and ends at the last radiator. The return main begins at the return side of the first radiator and connects to the return side of each radiator as it continues back to the return con- nection on the boiler. Each radiator in this type system has a different length supply and return, creating balancing prob- lems. Balancing cocks (Fig. 6-13) will be needed on the return from each radiator to ensure even flow to each radia- tor in the system. Two aquastats (high and low limit con- trols) maintain the boiler water temperature. A thermostat will operate the circulating pump to maintain set thermostat temperature. Two-Pipe Reverse-Return Systems Fig. 6-17 shows a reverse-return system, which has three zones. A zone is a floor or area served by a supply-return sys- tem where circulation of that floor or area is controlled by its own pump. In the reverse-return system shown in Fig. 6-17, the first radiator has the shortest supply main but has the longest return main. The supply main to each successive radiator is progressively longer, but as the supply main grows longer the return main grows progressively shorter. The actual devel- oped length of supply and return mains to each radiator is approximately equal; therefore the system is balanced, and each radiator should heat evenly. In larger systems with many radiators on each zone, balancing cocks may be needed to ensure an even flow to each individual radiator and to each zone. The initial cost of installing a reverse- return system is higher than for a direct return system, but the advantages of a reverse-return system are well worth the added cost.

Water hammer is caused by a shock wave traveling through water. In steam heating systems, the wave is often caused by steam passing at a high velocity over condensate collected in piping. Steam becomes trapped in pockets of water; rapid condensation causes these slugs of water to collide with considerable force and become audible as water hammer. Water hammer can cause severe damage to a piping system or its components. Hot-Water Heating Systems 103 Table 6-1 (continued) Problem Cause

Radiator being pitched away from supply valve C. Vent port of air valve being too large, allowing steam to enter radiator too rapidly

If radiator does not heat, this may be caused by: A. Air in radiator not venting. B. Drainage tongue of air valve being damaged or removed. C. Branch supply to radiator being too small. D. Vent port of air valve being clogged (one-pipe systems). E. Steam pressure higher than maximum working pres- sure of air valve (most likely when steam is supplied through a reducing valve from a high pressure supply). F. Branch supply being improperly pitched, causing a water pocket. G. Return branch being improperly pitched, causing a water pocket to form and trapping air (in a vapor system). H. In a gas- or oil-fired one-pipe vacuum system, some radiators may not heat if they were not completely heated on a previous firing. Remedy this by changing to a nonvacuum system by using open vents on radia- tors and mains. A radiator that cools quickly (one-pipe vacuum system) may be caused by: A. Air leakage into system, either through leaky joints or through the stuffing box of the radiator supply valve if an ordinary valve is used. B. A malfunction of the vacuum valve, preventing forma- tion of vacuum. C. On gas- or oil-fired system, a radiator cools quickly due to rapid formation of the vacuum. Change to a nonvacuum (open) system by changing the radiator and main vents to a nonvacuum type. Hot-Water Heating Systems 105

106 7. AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGERATION The information in this chapter is designed with three pur- poses in mind: • To explain the basic principles of refrigeration. • To acquaint refrigeration-servicing personnel with the recent changes brought about by Public Law 101–549. Public Law 101–549, and its impact on the servic- ing and repairing of refrigeration and air condition- ing equipment, is a very important segment of this chapter. • To provide servicing and troubleshooting information for air-conditioning and refrigeration technicians. But first, let’s deal with the basic principles of refriger- ation. Transfer of Heat from One Substance or Element to Another Thermodynamics is a branch of science that deals with the mechanical action of heat. Refrigeration is a process designed to transfer heat from one medium to another. Heat always travels from a warm body to a colder body. Heat exists at any temperature above absolute zero. Absolute zero, approximately 460°F below zero, is a theoretical term for the lowest temperature possible, the temperature at which no heat exists. Heat travels in any one of three ways: • Radiation. Radiation is the transfer of heat by waves. Heat from the sun is transferred by radiation. • Conduction. Conduction is the transfer of heat through a medium: water or metal. One substance must touch another for heat to be transferred in this way. • Convection. Convection is the transfer of heat by means of a fluid medium, either gas or liquid, normally

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 107 air or water. A hot-water fin tube convector transfers heat from the convector to air. Heat transfer cannot take place without a temperature difference. Measuring Heat The British thermal unit (Btu) is the basic unit used to mea- sure heat. A Btu is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. There are several different types of refrigeration and air- conditioning equipment, but the basic principles governing air conditioning and refrigeration apply to all systems. All refrigeration systems depend on two basic principles: A liquid absorbs heat when it boils or evaporates to a gas. Examples: • Freon 12 boils to vapor at –21°F at atmospheric pres- sure. • Water boils to a gas (steam) at 212°F at atmospheric pressure. • Liquid ammonia boils to vapor at –28°F at atmo- spheric pressure. As vapor or gas condenses to a liquid form, heat is released. The boiling point of a liquid is changed by changing the pressure the liquid is under. Raising the pressure raises the boiling point. Lowering the pressure lowers the boiling point. Fig. 7-1 explains the changes that take place as the refrig- erant is circulated through an electrical air-conditioning sys- tem. We will assume that the thermostat has called for cooling, the compressor is operating, and the fans in the air- handling unit and the condenser are energized. A typical electric air conditioner operates by introducing a hot liquid under high pressure into an expansion valve.

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

108 Air Conditioning and Refrigeration The expansion valve releases the hot liquid, lowering the pressure and causing the hot liquid to expand into a cold liq- uid plus vapor. The cold liquid plus vapor then passes through the evaporator, absorbing heat from the air sur- rounding the evaporator. As the liquid plus vapor passes through the evaporator coil absorbing heat, it is completely vaporized, changing from a liquid to a cold gas. The com- pressor pulls the cold gas from the evaporator or cooling coil through the suction line as fast as it vaporizes. Next, the compressor compresses the cold gas to a high pressure and, in the process, raises the temperature of the cold gas, chang- ing it to a hot gas. The increased pressure forces the hot gas through the condenser where either air or water removes the heat from the refrigerant gas. The hot gas must be at a higher temperature than the air or water surrounding the condenser in order for heat to flow from the gas to the air or water. As the hot gas gives off heat in the condenser, the gas condenses and becomes a hot liquid, still under high pressure. The hot liquid enters the expansion valve, and the process begins all over again. The reason this process works is that the hot gas leaving the compressor is hotter than the air (or water) passing AIR-COOLED CONDENSER HOT LIQUID EXPANSION VALVE COLD LIQUID & VAPOR COLD AIR OUT SUCTION LINE COMPRESSOR REFRIGERANT HAS ABSORBED HEAT AND IS COMPLETELY VAPORIZED HOT GAS UNDER HIGH PRESSURE Fig. 7-1 Air-conditioning system with an air-cooled condenser

Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 109 through the condenser. Thus the heat in the gas, absorbed at the evaporator, can flow to the air or water passing through the condenser. The two types of refrigerating compressors used in air- conditioning equipment are reciprocating compressors and centrifugal compressors. Water is used as a cooling medium for a condenser in many large air-conditioning systems. Cooled water from a cooling tower basin is pumped through the water jacket of a condenser. The cooled water absorbs heat from the hot gas in the refrigerant piping coils in the condenser. The water, now hot from the absorbed heat, is circulated to the cooling tower. There it runs into a distributing trough and drips down through the baffles in the tower. As the water drips down, it gives off the absorbed heat. The cooled water is now ready to be pumped back through the condenser to again absorb heat. Some water is lost through evapora- tion, so a makeup water valve is installed in the basin to maintain the proper water level. A typical cooling tower is shown in Fig. 7-2. A piping diagram of a system using a water-cooled condenser and a cooling tower is shown in Fig. 7-3. Gauge Manifold Whenever an air-conditioning unit must be serviced, the first thing the technician does is to connect a set of gauges to the unit. The most important tool used by the technician is the gauge set. It is used for checking pressures, adding refriger- ant, and many other purposes. The space available will not permit instructions for the use of this tool, nor is it necessary, because the technician for whom the balance of this chapter is written knows how to use it.

This legislation is designed to bring about changes in the way CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) and HCFCs (hydrochloro- fluorocarbons) are handled and disposed of. The legislation was enacted because a seasonal “hole in the sky,” a massive drop in stratospheric ozone levels was discovered in the Southern Hemisphere. The Clean Air Act establishes a program that includes production targets and use limits and bans, recycling require- ments, venting prohibitions, labeling requirements, and safe alternative measurements. Public Law 101–549, the “Clean Air Act Amendments,” is now in effect, and it is drastically changing the way refrig- eration and air-conditioning equipment is serviced and installed. Installation and servicing of refrigeration and air- conditioning equipment provide employment for pipefitters specializing in these fields. The intent of P.L. 101–549 is to prevent, so far as possible, the venting of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere. Section 608, subsection (c), paragraph 1, reads: “It is unlawful for any person in the course of maintaining, servicing, repairing, or disposing of an appliance or industrial process refrigeration to know- ingly vent or otherwise knowingly release or dispose of Class I or Class II refrigerants in a manner that permits such substances to enter the environment.” The penalty for intentionally allowing the venting of ozone-depleting chem- icals, CFCs and HCFCs, can be severe. On December 2, 1992, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fined a New England contractor $18,101 for venting an HCFC refrigerant. New refrigerant gases, such as R410A for commercial and industrial uses and 134A for automotive air condition- ers, are taking the place of ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs. You can search the Internet for information on new gases as they become available. Enter “refrigerant gases” in the search box of your browser.

112 Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractors (and employees) take note: If a contractor sends a technician on a service call that requires opening up a charged system and he or she does not have a certified refrigerant recovery or recycling unit on the job, he and you are technically in violation of the Clean Air Act. Failure to have the recovery or recycling unit on the job represents a strong presumption of guilt. Three Rs are the key to understanding the purpose of Public Law 101–549, recover, recycle, and reclaim. To recover refrigerant means to remove refrigerant in any condition from an appliance without necessarily testing or reprocessing it in any way. Since July 1, 1992, CFCs being removed from systems must be recovered. Recovery is not a choice; it is the law. It is very important to record the weight of the CFC removed. This will be taken into account when the unit is charged after repairs are made. To recycle refrigerant means to extract refrigerant from an appliance and clean refrigerant for reuse without meeting all the requirements for reclamation. Recycled refrigerant is refrigerant that is cleansed using oil separation and single or multiple passes through devices such as replaceable core fil- ter-driers, which reduce moisture, acidity, and particulate matter. Recycling is usually done at the job site. To reclaim refrigerant means to reprocess refrigerant to at least the purity specified in the ARI Standard 700–1988, “Specifications for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants” (Appendix A to 40 CFR part 82, subpart F), and to verify this purity using the analytical methodology prescribed in the ARI Standard 700–1988. In general, reclamation involves the use of processes or procedures available only at a reprocessing or manufactur- ing facility. Contaminated refrigerants and/or oils must be recovered and stored in containers, returned to a collection point (it may be the supply house the customer deals with), and returned to the reprocessor or manufacturer.

Most CFC-based systems in use today use a mineral oil lubricant. Studies have shown that there is poor miscibility between many of the alternatives to CFCs and mineral oil. New oils have been developed that are more compatible with alternative refrigerants. Now we come to the problem of selecting the equipment needed to recover and/or recycle the refrigerants. Because it is common practice to install refrigeration components on rooftops or other relatively inaccessible locations, both the size and weight of recovery and/or recycling units must be consid- ered. As the full impact of Public Law 101–549 on refrigera- tion and air-conditioning contractors is felt, the demand for recovering and recycling units may, for a time, exceed the avail- able supply.

A lightweight portable recovery unit for small system ser- vices is shown in Fig. 7-4. A typical recovery system hookup using the RS-503/13H unit is shown in Fig. 7-5. Used and/or contaminated refrigerant gases are sent to service centers, which return the contaminated products to the manufacturer for reclaiming and reuse. The refrigerant supply houses that the contractor deals with can supply information on recovery/recycling equipment and refriger- ant/oil disposal. The scope of work for pipefitters in the air-conditioning and refrigeration fields includes the unloading, setting, installation, and repairing of chillers, compressors, condensers, pumps, and, if used, pneumatic control systems. The installation and servicing of pneumatic control systems is another specialized branch of the pipefitter’s trade. Various control companies

The following servicing and trou- blingshooting instructions will help you to diagnose problems with refrig- eration and air-conditioning systems. Refrigerant Pressures Twelve of the most common refriger- ants are listed in Table 7-2. Each refrigerant is listed in a separate col- umn, and the pressures given are listed in pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or in inches of mercury if the pressures are below zero pound gauge pressure. The refrigeration technician’s bour- don tube gauge reads 0 psig when it is not connected to a pressure-producing source. Pressures existing below 0 psig are actually negative readings on the gauge and are referred to as inches of vacuum.

Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 117 the equivalent of inches of mercury. The column at the left of Table 7-2 shows the temperature in degrees F. The tempera- tures are given in 5° increments. The extremely low temper- atures are seldom encountered. The valves or controls can be adjusted to achieve a temperature falling between the 5° increments. In order to determine the vaporization pressure in the evaporator, the temperature of the liquid must be determined. Example With ammonia as the refrigerant, we want the ammonia to boil at 10° above zero F. The refrigerant plant will cool brine. The brine, cooled to approximately 25°, will be pumped to the cooling coils. By checking the temperature column at the 10° line, then following the line to the right under the heading Ammonia, you can see that the pressure should be 23.8 pounds. The head of condensing pressures can then be checked. This is done by taking the tempera- ture of the outlet water if the refrigerating unit is water cooled. If we assume that the water is leaving the condenser at a temperature of 90°F, a reference to Table 7-2 indi- cates that the head pressure should be approximately 166 pounds. If air-cooled apparatus is encountered, the temperature of the air passing over the condenser must first be determined. Let us assume that the air passing over the condenser is at a temperature of 70°F. Observe in Table 7-3, that one temper- ature column gives the temperature of the liquid in the evap- orator. In our particular case, the ammonia is evaporating at a temperature of 10°F. Therefore, find this specific tempera- ture in the left-hand column and continue horizontally to that point in the column headed 70°F. At this junction, the figure “35” is shown. This figure, 35, is added to the air tem- perature, 70°F, giving a total of 105°F. Turn to Table 7-2 and find the 105° line, corresponding to the temperature existing in the condenser. Table 7-2 gives the temperature at which boiling or vaporization of each particular refrigerant takes

120 Air Conditioning and Refrigeration place; the pressure at which this occurs is listed under the refrigerant type. If the refrigerant is ammonia at 15.7 psig, the liquid will boil at 0°F. If you desire a colder liquid, alter the pressure. This is accomplished in the refrigerating unit by adjusting the temperature control, if a thermostat is the controller (as with a low-side float), or by adjusting the thermostat or pressurestat in either a high-side or low-side float system. The continued operation will lower the evaporator tempera- ture and the temperature of the room in which the evaporator is located. With an expansion valve system, if a thermostat is employed to start and stop the system, the thermostat can be adjusted for a higher or lower temperature. Before and after the adjustment, the frost line on the evaporator should be checked. If the expansion valve is opened to admit more refriger- ant so that the pressure is raised and its boiling temperature is increased, the suction line may frost back. Also, if the expansion valve is closed so that less refrigerant enters the evaporator, the compressor will be unable to hold at a lower pressure and a lower temperature. When this is done, only a portion of the coil may be effective. A coil must contain liq- uid refrigerant to be able to refrigerate. Therefore, if only a part of the coil is frosted, the other part might as well be taken out because it is doing no work. It is best to maintain the highest pressure possible so that the compressor will work on the densest vapor without having the suction line frost back. It may be desirable, however, to make a change in the suc- tion pressure to alter the temperature of the coils. If a coil temperature at 20°F is desired with ammonia, the expansion valve must be adjusted to maintain a constant pressure of 33.5 psig in the evaporator. If a 40° temperature is desired, a 58.6 psig reading on the low side would have to be main- tained. If a 40° temperature were required in the evaporator of a methyl-chloride system, the expansion valve would have to be adjusted to hold a constant pressure of 28.1 psig.

Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 121 Table 7-2 lists the temperature of the liquid refrigerant boiling at the constant pressure given. One factor cannot be varied without varying the other. The only way to obtain another boiling temperature is to adjust the expansion valve to maintain the pressure that corresponds to the temperature desired. If the liquid is contained in a vessel or cylinder and the vessel is closed (such as in a supply drum), you will observe that the pressure in such a vessel is from 1 to 5 pounds greater than the temperature of the drum. This is due to the fact that pressure has built up and prohibits further evaporation. If a system contains an unknown refrigerant, such as one without an odor, the kind of refrigerant may be determined by taking a pressure reading of the refrigerant at rest, that is, while the unit is not operating. The pressure that corresponds most closely to the reading will identify the par- ticular refrigerant being tested. Table 7-2 is based on determining, from a pressure read- ing of the low side or evaporator, just what the temperature of the boiling liquid may be. With a methyl-chloride system, if the low pressure gauge reads 2 psig, the temperature corre- sponding to this pressure is given as –5°F in Table 7-2. With the temperature of the evaporator known (–5°F.) refer to Table 7-3. The first column in Table 7-3 on the left- hand side is the evaporator temperature. The other columns refer to the temperature of the water or air passing over the condenser. Assume that the room temperature is 70°F and that the air is passing over the condenser at this temperature. Since the evaporator temperature is known, find this temper- ature in the first column and then find the proper column for the coolant temperature (70°F.). At the intersection under these conditions, the figure 20 is given. This is added to the initial temperature, thus: 20° �70° �90°. Take this figure (90°) and refer to Table 7-2. Run down the temperature col- umn to 90° and then across to the methyl-chloride column. You will find that a head or condensing pressure of about 87.3 pounds can be expected. If the actual pressure reading varies from this, check the condition of the apparatus.

If the reading indicates too high a tem- perature, the expansion valve will have to be adjusted to maintain the proper pressure and, of course, the proper evaporating temperature. Head pressures are important; excessive pressures indicate something out of the ordinary. Much of the equipment required for refrigeration and air conditioning is large and heavy, and many times this equipment must be placed on roofs or in locations where a crane must be used to hoist the equipment. The crane operator in most cases cannot see beyond the edge of a roof or inside an enclo- sure, and signals must be used to guide the operator while he or she is hoisting and setting equipment.

Servicing A malfunctioning system may be caused by one part of the system or a combination of several parts. For this reason, it is necessary and advisable to check the more obvious causes first. Each part of the system has a definite function to per- form, and if a part does not operate properly, the perfor- mance of the entire air-conditioning system will be affected. To simplify servicing, especially with a system that is unfamiliar, the technician should remember that the refriger- ant, under proper operating conditions, travels through the system in one specified direction. The path of the refrigerant can be traced through any refrigerating system. For instance,

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

130 Air Conditioning and Refrigeration beginning at the receiver, the refrigerant will pass through the liquid shutoff valve. If this valve is partially closed, or is completely closed or clogged, no refrigeration is possible, even though the unit itself can and will operate. Strainers and Filters Most refrigerating units have a strainer or filter in the liquid line. If this device becomes clogged or filled with dirt, the liq- uid refrigerant will be unable to pass. Filters are usually designed to hold a certain amount of dirt, scale, metallic par- ticles, and so on and still function, but sometimes through carelessness, an excessive amount of extraneous matter may be allowed to enter the system during assembly or servicing. The remedy is obvious—the dirt and foreign matter must be removed to permit the refrigerant to pass through the filter. Copper Tubing Many smaller air-conditioning units make use of copper tub- ing for the liquid and suction lines. Because copper is not structurally as strong as iron or steel, it is relatively easy to collapse the copper line with an accidental blow, thus pre- venting the circulation of the refrigerant. When this happens, a new line or section of the line must be installed. Expansion Valves Expansion valves must be properly adjusted and in perfect working order to maintain the correct pressure in the low side of the line. In many cases, oil from the compressor crankcase enters and remains in the evaporator, occupying the space intended for the refrigerant. Naturally, this reduces the refrigerating effect, and service problems develop. The oil must be drained from the evaporator coil, and the compressor crankcase inspected to make sure the oil level is correct. Compressors Compressors will start developing trouble after long use as the pistons and rings, as well as the other components,

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 131 become worn. This wear allows some of the high-pressure gas to leak at the pistons and rings, so that proper compres- sion cannot be obtained, and the compressor becomes ineffi- cient and unable to take care of the load. New rings, pistons, and connecting rods are usually all that are required to bring the compressor back to its proper performance. Suction and discharge valves may stick, crack, or fail entirely. Sometimes, a slight warping or piece of dirt under them results in improper operation. Seals around the crankshaft may leak and require repacking or replacement. Condensers The condensers may become dirty and inefficient, resulting in high pressure, loss of efficiency, and an increase in the power requirement. Ducts Some air-conditioning ducts are provided with insulation on the inside, which may tear loose and flap, resulting in noise. Water Jets Water jets or spray heads (if used) may become clogged or worn. Automatic water valves may get out of adjustment, and the flow of water may become restricted because of clogging of the water strainer. Servicing Checks The proper diagnosis of air-conditioning system service problems can only be accomplished by intelligent thought, patience, and diligence. Each and every contributory factor must be considered and eliminated before going on to some other cause. The various important steps in checking a sys- tem are listed as follows: 1. Determine the refrigerant used in the system. This is an important factor because each refrigerant has its own operating characteristics, such as pressure-temperature differences.

132 Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 2. Install a gauge test set. If the unit is a large one, it will have a set of gauges as part of the equipment. The gauge test will indicate the condition of the refrigerant by checking the pressure-temperature relations. Put a thermometer on the evaporator coil, near the expan- sion valve, and obtain a reading. This temperature reading, along with a backpressure reading, will indi- cate the refrigerant condition. Then, check for improper expansion-coil pressure. 3. A low-pressure reading may be caused by a shortage of refrigerant, the presence of ice or water in the adjustment side of the expansion valve, moisture in the refrigerant system, plugged screens, partly closed liquid shutoff or service valves, excessive charge, or air in the system. Improper valve settings, blocked air cir- culation over the condenser, cooling air passing over the condenser at too high a temperature, reversed rotation of the motor, bent fan blades, or a clogged condenser are indicated by high head pressures. 4. Frost or a sweat line on the coil should be noted. A coil is only active up to its frost or sweat line. All lengths of tubing beyond the frost or sweat line are inactive, since they do not receive liquid refrigerant. For greatest effi- ciency, the entire coil must have frost or sweat, and if the liquid line is obstructed, the screen plugged, or the expansion improperly set, the proper amount of liquid refrigerant will not enter the evaporator, and only a limited portion of the coil will frost or sweat, depend- ing on the type of liquid refrigerant used. 5. An increase or overabundance of refrigerant will cause the entire coil, and possibly the suction line, to frost or sweat. This may also be caused by a leaky needle, improper adjustment, ice in the adjustment side of the expansion valve, or fused thermostat contacts. Most complaints with regard to excessive or insufficient frosting are due to weather conditions.

Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 133 6. Improper operation will occur if refrigerant has escaped from the system. The first thing to do when leakage has occurred is to detect and repair the leak. Indications of refrigerant shortage include hissing at the expansion valve, a warm or hot liquid line, little or no frost on the expansion valve or coil, continuous operation, low head pressure, and bubbles in the sight glass if it is inserted into the liquid line and used to test for refrigerant shortage. 7. Bubbles may form in the sight glass if the head pres- sure is under 120 pounds with F-12 and under 100 pounds with methyl chloride. An excellent indication of leakage is the presence of oil on a joint or fitting; methyl-chloride and F-12 dissolve oils, and when a leak occurs, the escaped refrigerant evaporates in the atmosphere, leaving the oil behind. Refrigerant must be added to system that has a refrigerant shortage until the bubbles in the sight glass cease, or until the hissing sound at the expansion valve is eliminated. 8. Check for improper installation. Compressor units and low sides must be level. Tubes and fittings forming the liquid and suction lines must be the proper size. Baffles, ducts, and eliminators must be properly located and not obstructed. Ducts must be insulated properly, or short-circuiting of air currents may take place, causing the ducts to sweat. Liquid and suction lines must be checked for pinches, sharp or flattened bends, and obstructions. Lines should not be run along the ceiling in a hot room, and the lines should not run adjacent to any active hot-water or steam pipes. 9. The location and installation of the thermostat must be checked. The thermostatic-switch bulb should be installed in a location where average temperature conditions exist. The thermostatic bulb, or switch itself (if self-contained), should not be placed where

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

134 Air Conditioning and Refrigeration an inrush of warm air, such as that caused by the opening of doors or windows, will cause the mecha- nism to cut in prematurely. Use thermostatic control switches with a minimum of tubing—gas will con- dense in long runs of tubing and the condensate will produce erratic operation. If a thermostatic bulb is used to control a liquid bath or brine, the bulb should be housed in a dry well or cavity, which should be located where average temperature conditions will be stable. 10. The condition of the thermostatic bulb should be checked. Apply heat gently by means of a cloth satu- rated with hot water or else hold the bulb in your hand. If the contacts do not close after applying heat, the thermostatic element is discharged. Dirty or oxi- dized contacts can also cause defective operation. 11. Starter fuses should be checked and, if blown, replaced with fuses of the proper size. Determine the cause of the trouble—shortage of oil, air in the system, over- charge, misalignment, high backpressure, lack of air or water over the condenser or motor—any of which may cause the fuses to blow. If the trouble is not cor- rected, serious damage can result in a relatively short time. . 12. Filters and/or screens must be checked. A clogged screen or filter, or a pinched or clogged liquid line, will produce the same trouble as a leaky or stuck expansion valve, depending on the degree of the obstruction. 13. A leaky or stuck expansion-valve needle will be indi- cated by a low pressure in the evaporator side and continuous operation of the unit. Sometimes a low- pressure control is wired in series with the thermo- static control and motor. When this is done, the low-pressure control will cut out, and the unit will remain inoperative.

8. PROCESS PIPING USING PLASTICS This chapter is intended to serve as a reference for those seek- ing information on various kinds of plastic pipe. And for those who do not know that plastic pipe can be welded, it may come as a surprise. The information is presented to walk the reader through the various steps of hot-gas welding. Process piping makes up a large part of pipefitters’ and welders’ work. Process piping can be generally defined as piping carrying substances, liquid or solid, used in manufac- turing or processing of other materials or substances. Types of Piping PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) Conforming to ASTM D-1784, Class 12454-B Formerly Designated as Type I, Grade I PVC is the most frequently specified of all thermoplastic materials. It is used for chemical processing, industrial plat- ing, chilled-water distribution, deionized water lines, chemi- cal drainage, and irrigation systems. PVC has high-quality physical properties and resistance to corrosion and chemical attack by acids, alkalis, salt solutions, and many other chem- icals. It is attacked, however, by polar solvents such as ketones, some chlorinated hydrocarbons, and aromatics. The maximum service temperature of PVC is 140�F. It has a design stress of 2,000 psig and the highest long-term hydro- static strength at 73�F of any of the major thermoplastics used for piping systems. PVC is joined by solvent cementing, threading, or flanging. The method used depends on the schedule pipe used, 40 or 80. CPVC (Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride) Conforming to ASTM D-1784, Class 23447-B, Formerly Designated as Type IV, Grade 1 CPVC has physical properties at 73�F similar to those of PVC, and its chemical resistance is similar to that of PVC. 142

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

CPVC, with a design stress of 2000 psig and a maximum ser- vice temperature of 210�F, has proven to be an excellent material for hot corrosive liquids, hot and cold water distri- bution, and similar applications above the temperature range of PVC. Like PVC, CPVC is joined by solvent cement- ing, threading, or flanging. Solvent Cementing of PVC and CPVC Pipe and Fittings PVC and CPVC pipe and fittings are made with a high-gloss hard finish. A primer must be used when solvent cementing if a good joint is to be made. Primer penetrates and softens the hard surfaces of both the pipe and fittings. Follow the instructions furnished with the primer. After the primer has softened the pipe and fitting surfaces, apply the PVC and/or CPVC cement. (PP) Polypropylene Homopolymer, Conforming to ASTM D 4101, Class PP110-B67154, Formerly Designated as Type I PP is a member of the polyolefin family of plastics. PP has less physical strength than PVC, but it is chemically resistant to organic solvents as well as acids and alkalis. Polypropylene should not be used in contact with strong oxidizing acids, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and aromatics. PP is useful for salt-water disposal lines, crude oil piping, and low-pressure gas-gathering systems. PP is an excellent material for labora- tory and industrial drainage when mixtures of acids, bases, and solvents are involved. Polypropylene is joined by the thermo-seal fusion process, threading, or flanging. PVDF (Kynar) Polyvinylidene Fluoride PVDF is a high-molecular-weight fluorocarbon that has superior abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, dielectric properties, and mechanical strength. PVDF maintains these characteristics over a temperature range of �40 to 250�F. PVDF is highly resistant to wet or dry chlorine, bromine and other halogens, most strong acids and bases, aliphat- ics, aromatics, alcohols, and chlorinated solvents. PVDF is Process Piping Using Plastics 143

144 Process Piping Using Plastics not recommended for use with ketones or esters. PVDF is joined by the thermo-seal fusion process, threading, or flanging. Pipe Preparation Cutting Plastic pipe can be cut easily using a power saw or handsaw, circular saw, or band saw. When a handsaw is used, it must be used with a miter box to ensure square cuts. Tubing cut- ters are designed for quick, clean cuts through plastic pipe. When tubing cutters are used, the cutters should have cut- ting wheels especially designed for cutting plastic pipe. The cutter shown in Fig. 8-1 has a quick-acting slide mechanism and is made in five sizes to cut plastic pipe from 1⁄8 through 6 in O.D. (outside diameter). The cutter shown in Fig. 8-2 has a compound ratchet lever mechanism and will cut pipe from 1⁄8 through 23⁄8 in O.D. Fig. 8-1 A quick-acting plastic-pipe cutter (Courtesy Ridge Tool Co.) Deburring and Beveling All burrs, chips, filings, and so on should be removed from both the pipe I.D. (inside diameter) and O.D. Use a knife,

half-round file, or a deburring tool (Fig. 8-3) to remove all burrs. Pipe should be beveled to approximately the angle shown in Fig. 8-4. Polypropylene Piping and Fittings Pipe Joining Polypropylene is joined by a process called thermal bonding, which applies to all NIBCO/Chemtrol polypropylene and Kynar pressure piping systems, including molded socket fit- tings and socket-type valve connections. This process involves the application of regulated heat uniformly and simultaneously to pipe and fitting mating surfaces so that controlled melting, the thermo-seal process, occurs at these surfaces. Due to space limitations, the thermo-seal process is not explained here, but can be found at the NIBCO/Chemtrol Web site. Repairing Thermoplastic Pipe Joints Because we talk about welding in this book, it is appro- priate to explain that there are times when welding must be Process Piping Using Plastics 145 Fig. 8-2 A compound-lever plastic-pipe cutter (Courtesy Ridge Tool Co.)

146 Process Piping Using Plastics performed on thermoplastic pipe. If a faulty or leaking joint is found, the most common method for repairing faulty and leaking joints is hot-gas welding at the fillet formed by the junction of the fitting socket entrance and the pipe. Hot-gas welding (which is similar to gas welding with metals, except that hot gas is used for melting instead of a direct flame), con- sists of simultaneously melting the surface of a plastic filler Fig. 8-3 Deburring tools (Courtesy Ridge Tool Co.) 1⁄16 TO 3⁄ 32 in 10—15° Fig. 8-4 Pipe beveled to correct angle

rod and the surfaces of the base material in the fillet area, while forcing the softened rod into the softened fillet. Welding with plastics involves only surface melting because plastics, unlike metals, must never be puddled. The resulting weld is not as strong as the parent pipe and fitting material; therefore, fillet welding is recommended for minor leaks only. Pipe and fittings must always be the same type; dissimi- lar pipe and fittings must never be joined. Polypropylene pipe and fittings must never be joined to Kynar pipe and fit- tings. Welding Tools and Materials Tools • A hot-gas welding torch (Fig. 8-5) with a 400 to 550- W (watt) heating element and pressure regulator equipped with pressure gauge • Cutting pliers • Hand grinder (optional) • Nitrogen or other inert gas (polypropylene or Kynar only) • Source of compressed air • Filler rod • Emery cloth • Cotton rags Weld Area Preparation Wipe all dirt, oil, and moisture from the joint area. A mild solvent may be needed to remove oils. CAUTION Make sure that all liquid has been removed from the portion of the piping system where the weld is to be made. Process Piping Using Plastics 147

Welding Faulty Joints 1. Remove residual solvent cement from the weld area using emery cloth (Fig. 8-6). When welding threaded joints, a file can be used to remove threads in the weld area. 2. Wipe the weld area free of dust, dirt, and moisture, using a cotton rag. 3. Determine the amount of the correct filler rod needed to make one complete pass around the joint by wrap- ping the rod around the pipe to be welded, as shown in Fig. 8-7. Increase this length enough to allow for handling the rod at the end of the pass.

150 Process Piping Using Plastics 4. Make about a 60�angular cut on the lead end of the filler rod (Fig. 8-8). This will make it easier to initiate melting and will ensure the fusion of the rod and base material at the beginning of the weld. 5.

600�F for PP, 575 to 600�F for Kynar). Welding tem- peratures can be adjusted for the various thermoplas- tic materials as well as any for desired welding rate by adjusting the pressure regulator (which controls the gas flow) between 3 and 8 psig. 6. With air or an inert gas flowing through the welding torch, insert the electrical plug for the heating element into an appropriate electrical socket to facilitate the heating of the gas, and wait approximately 7 minutes for the welding gas to reach the proper temperature. CAUTION The metal barrel of the heating torch houses the heating ele- ment. It can attain extremely high temperatures. Avoid con- tact with the barrel, and do not allow it to contact any combustible materials. 7. Place the leading end of the filler rod into the fillet formed by the junction of the pipe and fitting socket entrance (Fig. 8-9). Hold the filler rod at an angle of 90�to the joint for PVC, CPVC, and Kynar; 75�to the joint for polypropylene. Preheat the sur- faces of the rod and base materials at the weld starting point by holding the welding torch steady at approx- imately 1⁄4 to 3⁄4 in from the weld start- ing point and directing the hot gas in this area until the surfaces become tacky. During preheating, move the rod up and down slightly so that the rod slightly touches the base material.

152 Process Piping Using Plastics the surfaces become tacky, the rod will stick to the base material. 8. Advance the filler rod forward by applying a slight pressure to the rod. Simultaneously, apply even heat to the surfaces of both the filler rod and base material by moving the torch with a fanning or arcing motion at a rate of about 2 cycles per second. The hot gas should be played equally on the rod and base material along the weld line for a distance of about 1⁄4 in from the weld point, as shown in Fig. 8-9. IMPORTANT If charring of the base or rod material occurs, move the tip of the torch back slightly, increase the fanning frequency, or increase the gas flow rate. If the rod or base materials do not melt sufficiently, reverse the above corrective measures. Do not apply too much pressure to the rod because this will tend to stretch the weld bead, causing it to crack and separate after cooling. 9. When welding large-diameter pipe, three passes may be required. The first bead should be deposited at the bottom of the fillet, and subsequent beads should be deposited on each side of the first bead. 10. Because the starting point for a plastic weld is fre- quently the weakest part of the weld, always terminate a weld by lapping the bead on top of itself for a dis- tance of 3⁄8 to 1⁄2 in, as shown in Fig. 8-10 Never ter- minate a weld by overlapping the bead side by side. 11. Properly applied plastic welds can be recognized by the presence of small flow lines or waves on both sides of the deposited bead. This indicates that sufficient heat was applied to the surfaces of the rod and base materials to effect adequate melting and that sufficient pressure was applied to the rod to force the rod melt to fuse with the base material melt. If insufficient heat is used when welding PVC, CPVC, or Kynar, the filler rod will appear in its original form and can easily be

pulled away from the base material. Excessive heat will result in a brown or black discoloration of the weld. In the case of polypropylene, excessive heat will result in a flat bead with oversized flow lines. 12. Always unplug the electrical connection to the heating element and allow the welding torch (gun) to cool before shutting off the gas to the gun.

9. GROOVED-END AND PLAIN-END PIPING SYSTEMS Every pipefitter and sprinkler fitter should become familiar with the use of grooved-end and plain-end piping. There are two types of grooving: cut grooving and roll grooving. Grooved piping has been widely used in fire protection sys- tems for many years, and technological advances (and eco- nomic conditions) now make the use of grooved-end piping systems desirable in many applications. Grooved-end piping can be used in both metallic and plastic piping systems. Installation techniques are similar, so because of space limi- tations, only grooved-end and plain-end metallic piping is explained here. The Victaulic ® Company of America is the originator and developer of the grooved piping system of joining pipe and fittings mechanically. The concept is based on a rugged ductile iron housing, which grips into the pipe; a synthetic pressure-responsive rubber gasket to seal the system; and nuts and bolts to secure the components into a unified joint. Each joint is a union. The removal of two couplings permits removal of a section of pipe, a fitting, or a valve for cleaning, repair, or replacement. Cut-Grooving Metallic Pipe Utilization of the cut-grooved method is based on the proper preparation of a groove in the pipe end to receive the housing key. The groove serves as a recess in the pipe with ample depth for secure engagement of the housing, yet with ample wall thickness for full pressure rating. Fig. 9-1 is a cutaway view of a Victaulic ® cut-groove coupling showing how the gas- ket and the bolts are installed. Standard bolts for most cou- plings are heat-treated oval-neck track head bolts. The oval neck fits into oval-shaped holes in the housing, permitting the nuts to be tightened from one side with a ratchet wrench. 154

There are two types of couplings: one for rigid pipe installations, the other for flexible piping installations. Rigid couplings create a rigid joint, useful for risers, mechanical rooms, and other areas where flexibility is not desired. Flexible couplings provide allowance for controlled pipe movement—expansion, contraction, and/or deflection—to absorb movement from thermal changes, settling, or seismic action and to dampen noise and vibration. Pipe can be delivered to the job with the grooves already cut, or the grooves can be cut on the job. Tools designed for on- the-job use will groove pipe ranging from 3⁄4 to 24 in I.D. (inside diameter). Most are designed for power drive operation; smaller-sized groovers can be driven manually or by a power Grooved-End and Plain-End Piping Systems 155 RIGID FLEXIBLE (A) (B) GROOVE BOLTS AND NUTS GASKET HOUSING Fig. 9-1 Cutaway view of a Victaulic ® grooved piping coupling (Courtesy Victaulic ® Company of America)

Other tools will cut-groove metallic pipe in sizes from 8 through 24 in I.D. Fig. 9-2 Cut-grooving tool for 2�I.D. through 8�I.D. pipe (Courtesy of Ridge Tool Co.) A roll-grooving tool mounted on a power drive is shown in Fig. 9-3. Pipe can be cut to length, ready for grooving, by using standard pipe cutters or oxy-gas torches. If electric power is not available, pipe can be grooved using a hand- operated tool shown in Fig. 9-4 Grooved-end fittings are made for use with grooved-end piping. Tees, elbows, (90�, 45�, 221⁄2�, 111⁄4�), street ells, reducer ells, tees, reducer tees, crosses, wyes, flanged adapters, threaded adapters, and eccentric and concentric reducers are some of the many standard pattern fittings for use with grooved piping

systems. Fittings for American Water Works Association (AWWA) sized pipe are available. A wide assortment of grooved-end valves are made for use with grooved piping sys- tems. Various types of butterfly valves are shown in Fig. 9-5. Grooved piping systems are used extensively for process piping in industrial plants and mining operations, in oilfields and offshore oil-producing facilities, in power plants, and in municipal sewage and water treatment plants. Grooved piping systems are also used in fire protection systems for underground and aboveground mains, wet and dry standpipes, branch lines for sprinkler heads, and piping conducting Halon or other fire extinguishing materials. One of the principal advantages in the use of grooved pip- ing systems is that no oil or pipe dope is used in assembling Grooved-End and Plain-End Piping Systems 157 Fig. 9-3 A grooving tool mounted on a power drive

the components of the system, and contamination of the pip- ing from these products is eliminated. Plain-End Piping Systems for Steel Pipe The Victaulic ® plain-end method can be used to simplify the installation, maintenance, and repairs of piping systems. No special pipe end preparation is required. Pipe cuts should be square. Victaulic ® Plain-End Couplings can also be used with beveled-end pipe. The plain-end system uses grips in the cou- plings, which bite into the pipe ends and secure them, as shown in Fig. 9-6. These couplings are primarily designed for use on standard weight (Schedule 40) steel pipe. They are not intended for use on plastic pipe, plastic-coated pipe, or brittle pipe, such as asbestos cement or cast iron. They are not intended for use on pipe with a surface hardness greater than 150 Brinnell.

10. LEARNING TO USE AN INSTRUMENT LEVEL A skilled pipefitter should have a working knowledge of ele- vations. Especially on new construction, sleeves and boxes must often be set at exact points in reinforced poured- concrete walls and footings. Underground piping may have to be installed at an exact level to meet job specifications. An instrument level is a telescope (Fig. 10-1) mounted on a base equipped with leveling screws (Fig. 10-2). The base is screwed onto a tripod (Fig. 10-3) when the instrument is in use. The instrument level can be rotated a full 360° horizon- tally and, when properly adjusted, the level-indicating bub- ble will show that the instrument is level at any point of the compass, no matter in which direction the instrument is pointed. 161 CROSS-HAIR ADJUSTMENT LEVELING SCREW A LEVELING SCREW B FOCUSING KNOB LEVELING SCREW C LEVELING SCREW D LEVELING BUBBLE Fig. 10-1 An instrument level (Courtesy David White Instruments)

162 Learning to Use an Instrument Level Adjusting an instrument level must be done very care- fully in order to avoid damage to the instrument. After mounting the instrument on the tripod, swing the instru- ment so that the barrel is directly over two opposing screws (A and C, Fig. 10-2). Both screws should be turned equally and simultaneously in the same direction until the leveling bubble is centered. Then, swing the barrel 180°. The bubble should still be centered. Next, swing the barrel 90° until the barrel is directly over the other two opposing screws (B and D, Fig. 10-2). Adjust these screws until the bubble is centered. Then, reverse the instrument, turn the barrel 180° again, still over B and D; the bubble should remain centered. Swing it again to A and C and readjust these until the bubble is again centered. It may be neces- sary to repeat this process several times before the instru- ment is in a level position when pointed in any direction. Do not overtighten the adjusting screws. If the adjusting screws are overtightened, the bed-plate of the instrument can be damaged, thereby preventing leveling of the instru- ment altogether.

CAUTION If, after repeated tries, the bubble will not remain centered when the instrument is reversed, the instrument is faulty and should be repaired. Do not attempt to adjust the screws on the leveling bubble; this is a job for an instrument repair technician.

164 Learning to Use an Instrument Level One of the first steps when a new building is started is to establish a “benchmark.” This is usually done by a mechani- cal engineer. The benchmark is a fixed point from which all building measurements are taken, the top of an iron manhole in a street, for example. As the building goes up, the bench- mark can be transferred to other locations where it will be vis- ible from any point. This point is then given a number, and all vertical measurements of the building are based on this num- ber. Some architects and mechanical engineers use a number based on the height of the area above sea level: 745.00, for instance. Others may use the number 100.00. The metric sys- tem, consisting of 10ths and 100ths, is used because it is more accurate and easier to use than feet and inches. The number used is not important since it is merely a reference point from which all vertical measurements are made. Helpful Conversions and Equivalents Tables 10-1 and 10-2 provide helpful aids for converting to and from metric measurements. Table 10-3 shows conver- sions from fractions to decimals. Table 10-1 Conversion from Metric Approximate Conversions from Metric Measures When You Multiply by Symbol Know Length To Find Symbol mm millimeters 0.04 inches in cm centimeters 0.4 inches in m meters 3.3 feet ft m meters 1.1 yards yd km kilometers 0.6 miles mi As an example, if the benchmark is established at 747.00, plans may show a first floor, (ground level) finished height of 743.00, a second floor level of 753, and a basement floor level of 731.00. Numbers greater than the benchmark show elevations above the bench mark. The finished second floor

will be 6 ft above the benchmark. (747.00 �6 �753.00). Numbers lower than the benchmark show elevations below the benchmark. The basement floor level will be 16 feet below the benchmark. (747.00 – 731.00 �16.) When an instrument level is used, it must be set up at a point from which both the benchmark and the elevation to be located are visible. An engineer’s rod (Fig. 10-4) marked in 10ths and 100ths of a foot (metric scale) is set up on the benchmark, and with the instrument leveled and pointed at the rod, a reading is taken. In the example shown in Fig. 10-5, the reading is 5.25. This is the H.I., or height of the instru- ment, above the benchmark.

166 Learning to Use an Instrument Level Using the previous numbers, a pipefitter must set a sleeve for process piping in a form for a foundation wall. The sleeve must be centered at 2�8�below the finished first floor. How can he pinpoint this location? First, he will set up his instrument level and take a reading on an engi- neer’s rod placed on the benchmark. This reading shows 5.25, giving an H.I. of 5.25. It is very important that the rod be held straight when it is held to obtain a reading. If the rod is leaning toward the instrument, the reading will be high; if it is lean- ing away, the reading will be low. Every fitter working with eleva- tions will need an engineer’s rule. A 6-ft folding engineer’s rule is a con- version rule with feet and inches on one side and metric scale on the other side. This is shown in Fig. 10-6. With your thumbnail placed on the feet and inches side of the engineer’s rule, turn the rule over to see the equiva- lent metric scale. Example: 2�8� equals 2.68 metric feet. Subtracting 2.68 from 743.00 (finished first floor) shows that the elevation of the centerline of the sleeve will be 740.32. We know that the H.I. of the instrument is 5.25 above the bench- mark. We also know that the center- line of the sleeve must be 6�8�below the benchmark.

11. PNEUMATIC CONTROL SYSTEMS The installation and servicing of pneumatic control systems falls within the scope of work of pipefitters. If I were starting out to learn a trade all over again, I would specialize in the installation and servicing of pneumatic controls as soon as I had completed my apprenticeship or equivalent training as a pipefitter. The installation of pneumatic controls is a very spe- cialized field—and a very rewarding one. I’ll explain how and where training in this field is available at the end of this chapter. Although there are many uses for pneumatic controls in manufacturing facilities, process piping, the aerospace indus- try, fire systems control, theme parks, and numerous other areas, limited space will not permit the mention of all the uses of these automatic controls. In this chapter, we will be more concerned with pneumatic systems to control heating/ cooling and ventilating systems. The work involved includes the installation and servicing of air compressors, piping from compressors to pneumatically operated thermostats, valves, dampers, humidistats, and auxiliary devices. An air com- pressor specially designed for use with pneumatic controls is shown in Fig. 11-1. 169 Fig. 11-1 An air compressor especially designed for use with pneumatic controls (Courtesy Powerex)

170 Pneumatic Control Systems Fundamentals of Pneumatic Control A basic control system consists of a power supply, supply line, controller, output line, and the controlled device. A sim- plified basic control system is shown in Fig. 11-2. The air compressor (power supply) supplies pressure to the room thermostat (controller), which sends an output pressure sig- nal to the damper actuator to position the damper (con- trolled device). Fig. 11-2 A basic pneumatic control system (Reproduced from Johnson Controls, Inc.) Power Source Compressed air at a constant pressure of 15 to 25 psig (pounds per square in gauge) is used as the power source. The power supply is the most important component of the control system. If it fails, the entire system will fail. Pneumatic power air must be clean, dry, and free of oil, and must be at a con- stant pressure. A refrigerated air dryer (Fig. 11-3) will pro- vide dry air for the control system. Safe Operation Safe conditions are essential before mechanical equipment may be allowed to operate. “Fail-safe” pneumatic controls can pre- vent damage caused by freezing or overheating. Spring-loaded actuators and valves cause these devices to return to a fail-safe position in the event of temperature control failure.

System Operation All automatic control systems function on the “cause-and- effect” principle. This means that every component in the system has an effect on the other components. In Fig. 11-4 the thermostat (Tr) measures the temperature of the air surrounding it. As the temperature rises, the thermo- stat causes a reduction of the heat (Hi) being supplied to the room, which allows the room temperature (Rt) to stop rising or to drop. This affects the thermostat so that it adjusts its influ- ence on heat input until a balance between heat input and heat loss is established, resulting in stabilized room temperature.

172 Pneumatic Control Systems Thus, one change is dependent on another change, and a “closed-loop” system has been established. A closed-loop system is the arrangement of components to allow system feedback. For example, a heating unit, valve, and thermostat are arranged so that each component affects the other and can react to it. The relationship of “cause and ef- fect,” the interdependence of one thing upon another, is called “feed- back.” Feedback makes true auto- matic control possible. There are three basic elements that must be considered when putting together a closed-loop system. They are: 1. The Control Agent. The source of energy supplied to the system can be either hot or cold, such as steam, hot water, heated air, chilled water, electrical current, or refrigerant. 2. The Controlled Device. The instrument that receives the output signal from the controller and regulates the flow of the Control Agent. It is functionally divided into two parts: a. Actuator. Receives the output signal and converts it into force. b. Regulator. Valve body or damper that regulates the flow of the Control Agent. Note A valve or damper can be either normally open (NO) or nor- mally closed (NC) to regulate the flow of the control agent. The type to be used is chosen primarily for “fail-safe” operation.

3. Controller Action. The controller that is furnished may be either direct acting or reverse acting. The con- troller will allow the system to balance itself. a. Direct Acting. The output signal changes in the same direction in which the controlled or measured variable changes. An increase in the controlled variable results in an increased output signal. b. Reverse Acting. The output signal changes in the opposite direction from that in which the controlled or measured variable changes. An increase in the con- trolled variable results in a decreased output signal. The closed-loop system is the most commonly used sys- tem. A typical closed loop system with a two-position (either ON or OFF) pneumatic controller is shown in Fig. 11-5. The closed loop system (Fig. 11-6) uses a proportional pneumatic controller, which holds the valve open to admit just enough of the heating medium to the heating coil, maintaining the room temperature at or near the desired level. Actual Operating Sequence To put everything we’ve learned in perspective, let’s go to Fig. 11-5 to see exactly what happens when the room tem- perature drops. When the temperature drops below the set point of the thermostat, the thermostat (controller) opens the steam valve to the heating unit, which, in turn, heats the air in the room. Then, room temperature rises, providing feedback to the thermostat. The thermostat closes the steam valve when room temperature reaches the top limit of the differential. Differential The differential is the number of units the controlled vari- able must change before the output signal of a two-position controller changes from minimum to maximum, or vice versa. Pneumatic Control Systems 173

174 Pneumatic Control Systems An open-loop system (as shown in Fig. 11-7) is used in cer- tain instances (for example, when more heat is required to maintain a suitable room temperature as the outdoor temper- ature drops). It is possible to arrange a thermostat to measure outdoor temperature so as to cause the heat input (boiler operating temperature) of a building to increase as the out- door temperature decreases. The outdoor thermostat cannot measure the result of heat input to the room, hence there is no feedback. Building temperature or individual room tempera- tures would be controlled by one or more indoor thermostats. All control systems are composed of one or more loops. Most will be closed loops, but some may be open loops or a DIRECT-ACTING THERMOSTAT TWO-POSITION CONTROLLER NORMALLY OPEN VALVE F E E D B A C K Typical Closed Loop System with two-position pneumatic controller, Thermostat (controller) measures room temperature and opens valve (controlled device) when temperature falls to lower limit of differential. This admits steam to terminal unit which in turn heats the air in the room. Then, room temperature rises providing feedback to the thermostat which closes valve when temperature reaches top limit of differential.

combination of both. The proper combination of these ele- ments must be applied or the closed-loop system will not operate properly. It is necessary to understand the difference between closed and open loops in order to appreciate the results that can be expected. There are no perfect closed loops. In actual control conditions, outside forces constantly work on the various parts to change the balance and set the loop cycle in opera- tion to reestablish balance. If this were not the case, there would be no need for automated control. Pneumatic Control Systems 175 DIRECT-ACTING THERMOSTAT PROPORTIONAL CONTROLLER NORMALLY OPEN VALVE F E E D B A C K Typical Closed Loop System with proportional pneumatic controller and normally open valve with 3 to 6 PSIG spring. As in the two-position system, the thermostat controls the valve which supplies the medium to the system, as determined by feedback through room air. However, the proportional thermostat holds the valve open to the proper position to admit just enough of the heating medium (hot water) to the coil of the terminal unit to maintain room temperature at or near the desired level.

176 Pneumatic Control Systems To summarize, a closed-loop system is one in which each part has an effect on the next step in the loop, and each is affected by the action of the previous step. An open-loop system is one in which one or more of the steps have no direct effect or action imposed on the following step or is not affected by other steps in the loop. Controllers A controller must be sensitive to changes in the controlled vari- able and respond with a precise output signal of adjustable mag- nitude to prevent the controlled variable from deviating too much from the set point. A controller has two main parts: the measuring or sensing element and the relay, which pro- duces the output signal. Controllers can be classified in two types: two-position and proportional. Two-position control provides full delivery or no delivery of the power source (either on or off). Proportional control influences the power source in pro- portion to changes in the controlled variable requirements as measured and directed by the controller. For example, a pro- portionally controlled device such as a damper or a valve may be partially opened or partially closed as directed by the controller. Either type can be used. Selection is dependent on the desired results. Measuring Elements The measuring element of a controller converts the status or change in a controlled variable to a useful movement or Rt To Hi To = OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE Hi = HEAT INPUT Rt = ROOM TEMPERATURE Fig. 11-7 Schematic of components of an open- loop system (Reproduced from Johnson Controls, Inc.)

variation that will activate the relay to produce an output sig- nal. Three types of elements commonly used in control sys- tems measure temperature, relative humidity, and pressure. Temperature Temperature-measuring elements are made in various types to fit the several kinds of controllers. Wall-mounted ther- mostats normally use bimetal or vapor-filled bellows ele- ments. Remotely mounted or external elements have liquid, gas, or refrigerant-filled bulbs and capillaries. The capillary or connecting section on bulb types is furnished in various lengths to allow the controller to be mounted away from the measured variable. Bimetal elements are two thin strips of dissimilar metal fused together to form a device that reliably changes its shape at a constant rate as its ambient temperature changes. Because the two metals bonded together expand and con- tract at vastly different rates, the measuring element, held stationary at one end, bends as the temperature varies. Thus, temperature measurement is changed into a physical movement. Remote bulb elements are used when temperatures are to be measured in pipes, tanks, ducts, or relatively inaccessible locations or where a hostile environment would be detrimen- tal to the controller. Remote bulb elements are composed of three parts: the bulb or temperature-sensitive portion; the capillary, which transmits the variable temperature signal over its length; and the diaphragm or operating head, which changes the temperature measurement into motion. Humidistats Humidistats are designed to measure and control the relative humidity of a building, room, or area. The measuring ele- ments in a humidistat are usually made from materials that attract water and respond to humidity changes by changing their size and/or shape. Pneumatic Control Systems 177

178 Pneumatic Control Systems Pneumatic Tubing Copper tubing in sizes 1⁄8 in, 3⁄16 in and 1⁄4 in (all O.D., out- side diameter) is used in both inaccessible and accessible locations for pneumatic tubing. Pneumatic tubing installed in or under a concrete floor, in a masonry wall, in the plaster coating of a wall, or in the hollow space of a precast concrete plank is considered inaccessible. Polyethylene tubing with barbed fittings can be used in some installations, providing that the tubing is installed in a concealed-accessible location. Training in the Pneumatic Control Field The installation, servicing, and calibration of pneumatic control systems is a highly specialized field.

12. GAS PIPING The installation, testing, and connection of gas transmission lines, gas piping, and gas-fired appliances falls within the scope of work of pipefitters and welders. To fill a need for a single code that would cover all facets of fuel-gas piping and appliance installations, from meter set assemblies or other facilities composing the gas service entrance to consumers’ premises, a National Fuel Gas Code was devel- oped by representatives of the American Gas Association (AGA), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). The Code was approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is revised and updated as needed. The Code is listed as ANSI Z223.1 and NFPA 54. Copies may be obtained from ANSI and NFPA. The Uniform Plumbing Code contains a section on fuel- gas piping. The Southern Building Code Congress International has developed a “Standard Gas Code.” If a question should arise regarding the installation or ser- vicing of piping or appliances, the local authority (in certain codes the administrative authority) shall have final jurisdic- tion. Also, the word “shall” is a mandatory term. Although all gas codes and regulations are designed to promote safety in the installation of piping and the servicing of gas-fueled equipment and appliances, and are, therefore, basically similar, the reader is advised to become thoroughly familiar with the gas code enacted in his or her area of work. Types of Gases Manufactured Gas There are several types of manufactured gases. The most common kind is coke-oven gas, a by-product of manufactur- ing of coke from coal. Coke-oven gas has a heating value of 525 to 570 Btu (British thermal units) per cubic foot. 179

180 Gas Piping Mixed Gas Mixed gas is a mixture of natural gas and any of several types of manufactured gas. Natural Gas Natural gas, in its original state, is lighter than air and will escape upward in the event of leakage. If the leak is within a building where escape to the outside is impossible, the risk of fire and/or explosion is very high. Liquid Petroleum Gas Liquid petroleum (LP) gas is a fuel found in natural gas and is made up principally of propane or butane or a mixture of the two products. When demand is high, many utilities add liquid petroleum gas to natural gas. LP gas under moderate pressure becomes a liquid and is easily transported and stored. At normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, the liquid returns automatically to the gaseous state. The heat content of LP gas is about three times greater than that of natural gas and about six times greater than that of most manufactured gases. At atmospheric pressure, pure butane vaporizes or returns to gas at 32°F. Pure propane returns to gas at –44°F. Under normal conditions, these are the lowest temperatures at which the liquid turns to gas. For these rea- sons, propane is used more in cold climates; butane is used more in mild climates. LP gas is heavier than air and is colorless. Being heavier than air, leaking LP gas will pocket in low areas of a room, structure, or area. Explosions and fires resulting in loss of life and heavy property damage have occurred when a spark ignited pocketed LP gas. Suppliers add odors to LP gas to aid in detecting leaks. Kinds of Piping The kinds of piping, metallic or plastic, to be used in an instal- lation shall be determined by the building code or regulation in effect at the job site and by job specifications drawn up by the architect/mechanical engineer and/or gas supplier. The chemical

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

composition of gases used in an area is usually the determining factor. Black steel pipe may be acceptable in one area and not permitted in another area. For example, whereas regular type L or type K copper tube may be acceptable in one area, tin-lined type L or type K copper tube may be required in other areas or by other suppliers. A relatively new innovation in piping mate- rial is the use of CSST, corrugated stainless-steel tubing. Gas Meters Gas meters shall be located in readily accessible spaces and shall be placed in areas where they will not be subjected to damage. The location of gas meters is usually the responsi- bility of the gas supplier. Regulators When the gas supply pressure is more than the equipment is designed to handle, or varies beyond the design pressure lim- its of the equipment, a line gas pressure regulator shall be installed. Troubleshooting hint: Problem: No gas supply to building. Regulators are installed in conjunction with outside gas meters. If the venting connection of the regulator is blocked by snow, ice, or debris, the regulator may not be able to “breathe” (flex), shutting off the gas supply to the building. Low Pressure Protection If the operation of gas utilization equipment such as a gas compressor might produce a vacuum or a dangerous reduc- tion in gas pressure at the meter, a suitable protective device shall be installed. Such devices include, but are not limited to, mechanical, diaphragm-operated, or electrically operated low-pressure shutoff valves. Valves Gas valves shall be of the lubricated straight-way shutoff type and shall be placed in an accessible location. Valves Gas Piping 181

182 Gas Piping controlling appliances shall be located within 3�of such appliances. Combustion Air Gas-burning appliances or devices require a supply of air for proper combustion. Improper combustion will result in soot- ing, causing a heavy concentration of carbon monoxide. Consult the gas supplier for cubic feet of air required for proper combustion. Testing Methods Test pressure shall be measured with either a manometer (Fig. 12-1) or with a pressure-measuring device designed and calibrated to read, record, or indicate a pressure loss due to leakage during the test. After test pressure has been applied, the source of pres- sure shall be disconnected from the piping before testing begins. Test pressure shall be no less than 11⁄2 times the pro- posed working pressure, but not less that 3 psig, irrespective of design pressure. When a manometer is used, common practice is to lift off the burner on a gas stove, then slide the free end of the manometer tubing over the burner orifice. The manometer is prepared for use by pouring water into one side of the tubing until it equalizes at the zero point of the gauge. When the water level is equalized at the zero point, connect the rubber tubing to the orifice. Open the burner valve or (if testing gas pressure) turn on the gas and observe the reading on each side of the manometer tube. Figure 12-1 (A) shows the pressure equalized at the zero point. Figure 12-1 (B) shows the water column after pressure has been applied. The reading on the side connected to the test point shows 21⁄2 in below the zero point. The reading on the other side shows the water level at 21⁄2 in above the test point. Adding the two readings together gives the pressure applied, 21⁄2 �21⁄2 �5. If the water level equalizes during the test when using the manometer for testing, the pipe is leaking.

184 Gas Piping Test duration shall be not less than 1⁄2 hour for each 500 cubic feet of pipe volume or fraction thereof. The test dura- tion may be reduced to 10 minutes in a single-family home. Any reduction in test pressure shall be deemed to indicate a leak. CAUTION No substance other than air shall be introduced into the gas piping for testing purposes. Oxygen must never be used for testing. Leak Detection Any reduction of test pressure indicates a leak. The leak shall be located by means of an approved combustible gas detec- tor, soap and water, or an equivalent nonflammable solution. Open flames, candles, matches, or any method that could provide a source of ignition shall not be used. When the leak source is located, the leak shall be repaired and the piping system retested. Thread Compounds (Pipe Dope) Thread compounds (pipe dope) shall be resistant to the chemical constituents of the type of gas to be used. Use only the type of thread compound recommended by the gas supplier. Pipe Sizing Job specifications or detailed shop drawings usually indicate the required sizes for piping to fixtures or equipment. The quantity of gas to be provided at each outlet should be deter- mined from the manufacturer’s Btu rating of the appliance to be installed. To aid in the selection of correctly sized piping, Table 12-1 lists the approximate gas consumption of the average appliance in Btu per hr. Capacities for different sizes and lengths of pipe in cubic feet per hour for gas of 0.60 specific gravity, based on a pressure drop of 0.3 in of water column, are shown in Table 12-2. In adopting a 0.3 in pressure drop, due allowance for

186 Gas Piping an ordinary number of fittings should be made. Table 12-2 is based on a gas of 0.60 specific gravity. If you wish to use an exact specific gravity for a particular condition, correct the values in the table by multiplying by �0.6/sg To obtain the size of piping required for a certain unit, you must first determine the number of cubic feet of gas per hour consumed by the unit. Example It is necessary to determine the size of the piping in a gas- fired boiler installation when the burner input is 155,000 Btu/hr and the heating value per cubic foot of gas is 1000 Btu. Assume the distance from the gas meter to the boiler to be 75 ft. ft3 of gas/hr � total Btu>hr required by unit Btu>ft3 of gas Table 12-2 (continued) Iron-Pipe Sizes Length of (IPS) (Inch) Pipe (Feet) 1⁄2 3⁄4 1 11⁄4 11⁄2 105 65 131 285 450 120 120 270 420 150 109 242 380 180 100 225 350 210 92 205 320 240 190 300 270 178 285 300 170 270 450 140 226 600 119 192

By a substitution of values in the foregoing formula we obtain: ft3 of gas/hr �155,000�1000 � 155 From Table 12-2 it will be noted that a 1-in pipe 75 ft long will handle 155 ft3/hr with 0.3-in pressure drop. The determination of gas pipe sizes for other appliance units can be made in a similar manner. Example It is necessary to determine the pipe size of each section and outlet of a piping system with a designated pressure drop of 0.3 in the water column. The gas to be used has a specific gravity of 0.60 and a heating value of 1000 Btu per cubic foot. Reference to the piping layout and a substitution of val- ues for maximum gas demand for the various outlets, Fig. 12-2, shows that the demand for individual outlets will be as follows: Gas demand for outlet A �55,000⁄1000 �55 ft3/hr Gas demand for outlet B �3,000⁄1000 �3 ft3/hr Gas demand for outlet C �65,000⁄1000 �65 ft3/hr Gas demand for outlet D �116,000⁄1000 �116 ft3/hr From the piping layout in Fig. 12-2, it will be noted that the length of gas pipe from the meter to the most remote out- let (A) is 105 ft. This is the only distance measurement used. Reference to Fig. 12-2 indicates: Outlet A supplying 55 ft3/hr requires 1⁄2-in pipe. Outlet B supplying 3 ft3/hr requires 1⁄2-in pipe. Outlet C supplying 65 ft3/hr requires 3⁄4-in pipe. Outlet D supplying 116 ft3/hr requires 3⁄4-in pipe. Section 3 supplying outlets A and B, or 58 ft3/hr, requires 1⁄2-in pipe. Gas Piping 187

190 Gas Piping Pipe Supports Pipe must be properly supported and not subjected to unnec- essary strain. Fig. 12-4 shows a pipe supported by pipe clips or straps fastened to the building floor joists. The maximum distance at which these supports should be spaced depends on the pipe size. The following distances between supports should never be exceeded, closer spacing being preferable. 3⁄8-in and 1⁄2-in pipe—6 ft 3⁄4-in and 1-in pipe—8 ft 11⁄4 in and larger (horizontal)—10 ft 11⁄4 in and larger (vertical) every floor—level GAS PIPE ATTATCHED TO JOISTS WITH PIPE CLIPS Fig. 12-4 Gas piping should be supported from the joists Pipe shorter than the support spacing listed should also be adequately supported. Whenever a branch fitting is used, or wherever there is a change of direction of 45° or more, a support should be provided within 6 in of one side of the angle fitting. Pipe straps or iron hooks should not be used for securing pipe larger than 2 in. Beyond this size, when pipe is horizon- tal and is to be fastened to floor joists or beams, pipe hang- ers should be used. When the pipe is to be fastened to a wall, ring hangers and plates should be used.

When pipes run crosswise to joists or beams, do not cut the timbers deeper than one-fifth of the depth of the timbers, as shown in Fig. 12-5. This cutting should be as near the sup- port of the beam as possible (Fig. 12-6) but in no case should it be farther from a support than one-sixth of the span.

LOWEST POINT HORIZONTAL LINE PITCH FOR DRAINAGE DRIP NIPPLE CAP Fig. 12-7 Horizontal runs of gas pipe should have slight pitch Corrugated Stainless-Steel Tubing (CSST) CSST systems consist of flexible corrugated stainless-steel tubing, manifolds, regulators, valves, and fittings, complete with striker plate protectors and installation instructions. The installation of CSST for interior fuel-gas piping systems has been approved by American National Standards Institute ANSI/A.G.A/LC 1-1991. The ANSI standard is rec- ognized in the National Fuel Gas Code of 1988, the American Gas Institute (AGA), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the Southern Building Code Congress Standard Gas Code, BOCA National Mechanical Code, and the CABO one and two-family Dwelling Code. The ANSI Standard applies to piping systems not exceeding 5 psig (pounds per square inch gauge) and not exceeding a size of 1 in I.D. (inside diameter). CSST is not intended for installa- tion by the general public; installers must be trained by the manufacturer, its representatives, or other experienced orga- nizations.

CSST, if approved by the local administrative authority and/or by the architect or mechanical engineer, can be installed in any new or existing residential or commercial building. CSST is especially suited for the retrofitting mar- ket, where limited space, structural obstructions, or other difficult installation problems could exist. Space limitations prohibit an in-depth explanation of CSST systems in this book. Manufacturers of CSST systems will furnish informative literature on the installation of their products. In the absence of a nationally adopted and enforced fuel- gas code, pipefitters installing fuel-gas piping must conform to local regulations or codes in force at the job site. Gas Piping 193

13.TUNGSTEN INERT GAS WELDING Tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) can be done on many met- als, but because this book is written for pipefitters and welders, the information in this chapter pertains specifically to steel pipe and stainless-steel welding. The TIG arc welding process, also called gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode to create the electric arc shown in Fig. 13-1. TIG welding can be done manually or, using a machine, automatically. The tungsten electrode is uncoated, and the arc is shielded by an inert gas or gases that 194 ACHF, DCSP, OR DCRP POWER SUPPLY GAS CUP EITHER CERAMIC HIGH-IMPACT OR WATER-COOLER METAL INERT GAS SHIELDS ELECTRODE AND WELD PUDDLE FILLER METAL SINGLE PASS WELDS IN THICKNESS UP TO 1⁄2″ MULTIPASS WELDS IN HEAVIER THICKNESS WELDS MADE WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITION OF FILLER METAL TUNGSTEN ELECTRODE VIRTUALLY NONCONSUMABLE WELD SURFACE IS SMOOTH AND CLEAR Fig. 13-1 Essentials of the TIG welding process

Note: The recommendations in this chart apply to genuine HELIARC tungsten electrodes Direct Current Welding In direct current welding, the welding current circuit may be connected as either “straight polarity” or “reverse polarity.” The machine connection for direct current straight polarity (DCSP) is electrode negative and workpiece positive. The elec- trons flow from the electrode to the workpiece. For direct cur- rent reverse polarity welding (DCRP), the machine connection is electrode positive and workpiece negative. When straight polarity is used, the electrons exert a considerable heating effect on the workpiece; in reverse of polarity welding, where the electrode acquires this extra heat, which tends to melt off the end of the electrode. Therefore, for any given welding current, DCRP requires a larger diameter electrode than does DCSP. For example, a 1⁄16-in diameter pure tungsten electrode can handle 125 amperes of straight polarity welding current. If the polarity were reversed, this amount of current would melt off the electrode and contaminate the workpiece.

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

Therefore, a 1⁄4-in diameter pure tungsten electrode is needed to handle 125 A (amperes) DCRP. These opposite heating effects influence not only the welding action but also the shape of the weld being made. DCSP welding will produce a narrow, deep weld; DCRP, using a larger diameter electrode, gives a wide, relatively shallow weld. When DCRP is used, the electrons and gas ions tend to remove the surface oxides and scale usually pre- sent, thus cleaning the weld area. Alternating Current Welding When ac welding current is used, half of each ac cycle is DCSP, the other half is DCRP. Moisture, oxides, scale, and so on, on the surface of the workpiece tend to prevent the flow of current in the DCRP half-cycle partially or even completely. This is called rectification. If no current were to flow in the reverse polarity direction, all cleaning action would be lost. To prevent this from happening, it is common practice to introduce into the current a high-voltage, high-frequency, low-power additional current. This high- frequency current jumps the gap between the electrode and the workpiece and pierces the oxide film, thereby forming a path for the welding current. Superimposing this high-voltage, high-frequency current provides the following advantages: • The arc may be started without touching the electrode to the workpiece. • Better arc stability is obtained. • A longer arc is possible. • Welding electrodes have longer life. • The use of wider current ranges for a specific diameter electrode is possible. Types of Joints The principal basic types of joints used in TIG welding are the butt, lap, corner, edge, and tee. Regardless of the type of joint, the workpiece must be cleaned prior to welding. Tungsten Inert Gas Welding 199

200 Tungsten Inert Gas Welding Manual cleaning with a wire brush or chemical solvent is usually sufficient. Shielding Gases The objective of TIG is to enable welds to be made without the contaminating influence of the air in the workplace. To accomplish this, shielding gas or gases flow from the torch nozzle over and around the weld arc and workpiece. The shielding gas flows at a prescribed rate measured in cubic feet per hour (CFH) or liters per hour (LPH). The selection of the proper gas or gas mixture depends on the material being welded. Gas distributors can supply this information. Argon, an inert gas, is the most commonly used shielding gas for TIG welding. Its low thermal conductivity produces a narrow, constricted arc column, which allows greater varia- tions in arc length with minimal influence on arc power and weld bead shape. For ac welding applications, argon is pre- ferred over helium because of its superior cleaning action, arc stability, and weld appearance. Helium is also an inert gas and produces higher arc volt- ages than argon for a given current setting and arc length. This produces a “hotter” arc. Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide These gases are chemically reactive and should not be used with TIG welding. Their high oxidation potential destroys the tungsten electrode under the heat of the arc. Gas Flow Rate Gas flow rate can range from a few CFH to more than 60 CFH, depending on the current, the torch size, and sur- rounding drafts. In general, a higher current will require a larger torch and higher flow rates. In addition, gas density, or the weight of the gas relative to the air it needs to dis- place, has a major influence on the minimum flow rate required to effectively shield the weld. Argon is approxi- mately 1.4 times as heavy as air and 10 times as heavy as helium. The effect of these densities relative to air is shown

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

in Fig. 13-2. Argon, after leaving the torch nozzle, forms a blanket over the weld area, whereas helium tends to rise in turbulent fashion around the nozzle. To produce equivalent shielding effectively, the flow of helium must be 2 to 21⁄2 times that of argon. The same general relationship is true for mixtures of argon and helium, particularly those high in helium content. Gas flow rate must be selected with care. It is not productive or economical to use more gas than neces- sary to achieve good shielding. Excess gas pulls air into the welding arc, often causing porosity in the weld. A flow device that limits gas flow to the optimal range is recom- mended. Gas Preflow and Postflow Gas preflow and postflow minimize contamination of the weld zone and electrode. A preflow of shielding gases removes moisture, which may have entered the system. Changes in room temperature can cause air to move in and out of the end of a torch while not in use, resulting in mois- ture condensing on the inside of the torch. When the gas is turned on, the moisture mixes with the gas as it leaves the nozzle. A preflow of shielding gas for a period of time before the arc is initiated will remove the moisture. Postflow works in a different way. When the arc is turned off, the weld metal begins to cool, but for a few moments the weld metal remains hot enough to be contaminated by the air surrounding the just-completed weld. To prevent this, the shielding gas is allowed to flow for several seconds after the arc is extinguished. (The length of time depends on the size and temperature of the weld.) The postflow of gas also pro- tects the hot electrode from contamination. Backup Shielding and Trailing Shields It is sometimes necessary to use shielding gas on the under- side of a weld to prevent oxidation of the hot weld bottom. Backup shielding gas is used to purge the air from the inside of piping. This procedure prevents contamination of the Tungsten Inert Gas Welding 201

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

202 Tungsten Inert Gas Welding backside of a weld while the pipe is being welded from the outside. In some instances, the welding may occur too fast for the shielding gas to protect the weld until it has cooled. As the arc moves on, the solidified weld metal remains hot and oxidizes. A trailing gas shield can be use used to prevent this oxidation from occurring. The Advantages of TIG over Shielded Metal Arc Welding In any type of welding, the best obtainable weld is one that has the same chemical, metallurgical, and physical proper- ties as the base metal itself. To obtain such conditions, the molten weld puddle must be protected from the atmo- sphere during the welding operation; otherwise, atmo- spheric oxygen and nitrogen will combine readily with the molten weld metal and result in a weak, porous weld. In TIG welding, the weld zone is shielded from the atmo- sphere by an inert gas, which is fed through the welding torch. Either argon or helium may be used. Argon is widely used because of its general suitability for a wide variety of metals and for the lower flow rates required. Helium pro- vides a hotter arc, allowing 50 to 60 percent higher arc voltage for a given arc length. This extra heat is especially useful when welding heavy sections. Gas mixtures of argon and helium are used to provide the benefits of both gases. The use of nonconsumable tungsten electrodes and inert shielding gases produces the highest-quality welds of any open-arc welding process. Welds are bright and shiny, with no slag or spatter, and require little or no post-weld clean- ing. The inert gases (argon, helium, or a combination of the two) can provide 100 percent protection from the atmo- sphere, making TIG welds stronger, more ductile and more corrosion resistant than welds made with ordinary arc- welding processes. Since no flux is used, corrosion due to flux entrapment cannot occur. TIG is easily used in all welding positions and provides excellent puddle control. Various combinations of dissimilar metals can be welded using the TIG process.

Starting the Arc In ac welding, the electrode does not have to touch the workpiece to start the arc. The superimposed high-fre- quency current jumps the gap between the welding elec- trode and the work, thus establishing a path for the welding current to follow. To strike an arc, first turn on the power supply and hold the torch in a horizontal position about 2 in above the workpiece, as shown in Fig. 13-3. Then, quickly swing the torch down toward the workpiece so that the end of the electrode is about 1⁄8 in above the workpiece. The arc will then strike. This downward motion should be made rapidly to provide the maximum amount of gas protection to the weld zone.

Tungsten Inert Gas Welding 205 at the time the arc strikes, and the steps involved in making TIG welds are shown in Fig. 13-4. In dc welding, the same motion is used for striking an arc. In this case, the electrode must touch the workpiece in order for the arc to start. As soon as the arc is struck, the electrode must be withdrawn approximately 1⁄8 in above the workpiece to avoid contaminating the electrode in the molten puddle. High frequency is sometimes used to start a dc arc, eliminating the need to touch the workpiece. The high frequency is automatically turned off when the arc is started. The arc can be struck on the workpiece itself or on a heavy piece of copper or scrap steel and then carried to the starting point of the weld. Do not use a carbon block for starting the arc; the electrode would be contaminated, causing the arc to wander. When you are starting to weld with a hot electrode, the action must be very rapid, because the arc tends to strike before the torch is in proper position. Stopping the Arc To stop an arc, snap the electrode back up to the horizontal position. This motion must be made rapidly to prevent the arc from marring or damaging the weld’s surface or the workpiece. When current density of the electrode is at a suf- ficiently high level, the entire end of the electrode will be in a molten state and completely covered by the arc. When too low a current density is used, only a small area of the elec- trode becomes molten, resulting in an unstable arc, which has poor directional characteristics and is difficult for the operator to control. Too high a current density results in excessive melting of the end of the electrode. Striking an arc with a carbon pencil or on a carbon block is a primary cause of arc wandering. When the carbon touches molten tung- sten, tungsten carbide is formed. Tungsten carbide has a lower melting point than pure tungsten and forms a large

206 Tungsten Inert Gas Welding molten ball on the end of the electrode. This ball, in effect, reduces the current density at the electrode end, and arc wandering then occurs. The electrode can also be contami- nated by touching it to the workpiece or filler rod. When electrode contamination occurs in any form, it is best to break off the contaminated end and regrind the end of the electrode. Arc Wandering With the torch held stationary, the points at which the arc leaves the electrode and impinges upon the workpiece may often shift and wander without apparent reason. This is known as “arc wandering” and is generally attributed to one of the following causes: • Low electrode current density • Carbon contamination of the electrode • Magnetic effects • Air drafts The first two causes are distinguished by a very rapid movement of the arc from side to side, generally resulting in a zig-zag weld pattern. Magnetic effects, the third cause, generally displace the arc to one side or the other along the entire length of the weld. The fourth cause creates varying amounts of arc wandering, depending upon the amount of air draft present. TIG Pipe Welding 1. Root pass, rolled joint. This will be a standard vee joint with a 37° bevel on each side, a 1⁄16 in nose and a 1/16 to 3/32-in spacing. After the joint has been tacked (four tacks 90° apart), the arc is struck on the side and carried down to the bottom of the joint. Filler metal is added until the pud- dle bridges over the gap. After the puddle bridges the

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

joint, the arc is held until the puddle flattens out and becomes wedge shaped, straight across the front and rounded at the rear. When this takes place, the puddle has fully penetrated the joint. 2. Filler pass. Weave or zig-zag beads can be used on low alloy steel in the rolled position. Stringer beads laid parallel to the joint are used for stainless-steel pipe. Weave or zig-zag welds can be used on low alloy steel pipe. Stringer beads are required for stainless-steel heavy wall pipe in all positions and for low alloy pipe in the vertical-fixed position. 3. Finish Pass. The final pass should be about 1⁄16 in above the surface of the pipe. The chief advantage of TIG welding for the fabrication of piping systems is that the welds are smooth, fully pene- trated, and free from obstructions or crevices on the inside. TIG welds are stronger and more resistant to corro- sion than welds made by any other process. Another advantage is that in today’s economy production costs are very important, and TIG welding results in savings in labor costs by eliminating the labor involved in removal of slag and spatters. Safety Precautions • Keep your head out of the fumes while welding. • Provide sufficient ventilation. • Welding inside tanks, boilers, or confined spaces requires the use of an air-supplied hood or a hose mask. • Ground all electrical equipment and the workpiece (Fig. 13-5). These are only a few of the many safety precautions welders and pipefitters should take.

To find the area of a circle, multiply the product of the radius times the radius by pi (3.142). Commonly written A ��r2. Braze Weld or Brazing—A process of joining metals using a nonferrous filler metal or alloy, the melting point of which is higher than 800°F but lower than that of the metals to be joined. Butt Weld—A circumferential weld in pipe, fusing the abutting pipe walls completely from inside wall to out- side wall. Carbon Steel—A steel that owes its distinctive proper- ties chiefly to the various percentages of carbon (as dis- tinguished from the other elements) which it contains. Circumference of a Circle—The measurement around the perimeter of a circle. To find the circumference, multiply pi (3.142) by the diameter. (Commonly writ- ten as d). Coefficient of Expansion—A number indicating the degree of expansion or contraction of a substance. The coefficient of expansion is not constant and varies with changes in temperature. For linear expansion, it is expressed as the change in length of one unit of length of a substance having a one-degree rise in tem- perature. A Table of Expansion (see Appendix, Table A.11) is generally used to determine expansion or con- traction within a piping system. Corrosion—The gradual destruction or alteration of a metal or alloy caused by direct chemical attack or by electrochemical reaction.

238 Appendix: Miscellaneous Information Search the Web for more information: pipe trades apprenticeship Vocational schools, public and private, on or above the high school level, also offer classes on building trades. In Ontario, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities, through its Workplace Support Services offices, helps tradespeople to obtain recognition of their trade quali- fications and experience, or to enter an apprenticeship. Tradespeople who have enough related work experience to meet Ontario standards and who pass a written examination receive a Certificate of Qualification. There are two categories of trades: those for which certi- fication is mandatory and those for which it is voluntary. Skilled Trades for Which Certification Is Mandatory To work in certain trades in Ontario, you must have a Certificate of Qualification or be a registered apprentice (see section on apprenticeship). The following are trades for which certification is mandatory: Alignment and Brakes Technician Autobody and Collision Damage Repairer (Branch 1) Autobody Repairer (Branch 2) Automotive Electronic Accessory Technician • Automotive Service Technician • Electrician (Construction and Maintenance) • Electrician (Domestic and Rural) • Fuel and Electrical Systems Technician • Hairstylist • Mobile Crane Operator (Branch 1) • Mobile Crane Operator (Branch 2) • Motorcycle Mechanic • Plumber

• Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Mechanic • Sheet Metal Worker • Steamfitter • Tower Crane Operator • Transmission Technician • Truck and Coach Technician • Truck-Trailer Service Technician Skilled Trades for Which Certification Is Voluntary You do not need a Certificate of Qualification to work in various other trades in Ontario. Employers and unions in these trades may, however, ask for a Certificate of Qualification. Trades for which certification is voluntary include: • Air-Cooled and Marine Engine Mechanic • Arborist • Assistant Cook • Automotive Machinist • Automotive Painter • Baker • Boat Motor Mechanic • Brick and Stone Mason • Cement Mason • Construction Boilermaker • Construction Millwright • Cook • Electronics Service Technician • Farm Equipment Mechanic • Fitter (Structural Steel/Platework) • General Machinist Appendix: Miscellaneous Information 239

240 Appendix: Miscellaneous Information • Glazier and Metal Mechanic • Nursery Greenhouse Worker • Industrial Electrician • Industrial Mechanic (Millwright) • Industrial Woodworker • Ironworker • Junior Baker • Lather • Marine and Small-Powered Equipment Mechanic • Mouldmaker • Painter and Decorator (Commercial and Residential) • Painter and Decorator (Industrial) • Patissier • Pattern Maker • Printer • Small Engine Technician • Sprinkler and Fire Protection Installer • Tool and Die Maker Steps in Obtaining a Certificate of Qualification 1. Contact a Workplace Support Services office (see list of offices, on the reverse) to book an appointment with a training consultant. 2. Bring the following documents with you to your appointment: • Social Insurance Number card • Letter(s) from current or past employers, written on company letterhead and dated, providing the company name and address, the exact dates of your employment, your job title, and a detailed descrip- tion of your duties

*Source: AudelPipefittersWeldersPocketManual*

• Letter(s) from the union(s) to which you have belonged (if applicable), with the same information as noted above • Certificates, diplomas, or licenses • Official school transcripts from your training, if available, that contain course descriptions If your documents are not in English, they must be translated and signed by an official translator who has seen the originals. For assistance, contact the Association of Interpreters and Translators of Ontario at 1-800-234-5030. 3. The training consultant will look at your documents and tell you whether you have the necessary skills and experience to write the Certificate of Qualification examination. If your trade is a compulsory trade, you will be given a Letter of Permission, which is a tempo- rary license. The Letter of Permission, which is valid for 90 days, allows you to work until you write the exam. If you do not have the necessary skills and expe- rience to write the examination, you will be advised to enter an apprenticeship training program. 4. Pass the written examination. Note that the passing mark is 70 percent. Apprenticeship If you do not have or cannot prove that you have enough related work experience in the trade in which you would like to work, you may be required to complete an apprenticeship. Apprentices receive a specific number of hours of on-the-job training in a skilled trade. Most of the time is spent on prac- ticing skills in the workplace. The rest is spent on studying theory in a classroom, usually at a local community college. Apprentices are responsible for finding an employer who is willing to oversee their work throughout the apprentice- ship. As an apprentice, you are an employee and, therefore, Appendix: Miscellaneous Information 241

EQUIVALENT CAPACITIES OF PIPES OF SAME LENGTH—STEAM (Cont’d) This table may be used to find the number of smaller pipes equivalent in steam-carrying capacity to one larger pipe. It may also be used to find the size of a larger pipe equivalent to several smaller ones.The pipes in either case must be of the same lengths. Example 1—Find the number of 1-in pipes each 50 ft long equivalent to one 4-in pipe 50 ft long. Solution 1—Follow down column headed 4 in to the point opposite 1 in, in the vertical column, and you will find that it will take 44 of the 1-in pipes in parallel to equal one 4-in pipe in steam-carrying capacity. Example 2—Find the size of one pipe equivalent to four 2-in pipes in steam-carrying capacity. Solution 2—Find 2 in, in the vertical column headed "Size" and follow across horizontally until closest number to 4 is found.The nearest to 4 is 4.5. Following this column up, you will find that the size is 31⁄2-in. One 31⁄2-in pipe is, therefore, equivalent in steam-carrying capacity to approximately four 2-in pipes.

298 Appendix: Miscellaneous Information WATER REQUIRED FOR HUMIDIFICATION The approximate rule for calculating the amount of water required per hour to maintain any desired humidity in a room is: Multiply the difference between the number of grains of moisture per cubic foot of air at the required room temperature and humidity and the number of grains per cubic foot of outside air at the given temperature and humid- ity by the cubic contents of the room by the number of air changes per hour and divide the result by 7000 (this method disregards the expansion of air when heated.) For most localities, it is customary to assume that the average humidity of outside air is 30 to 40 percent. Example: Grains of moisture at 70�& 40 percent humidity �3.19 Grains of moisture at 0�& 30 percent humidty �0.17 Grains of moisture to be added per ft3 �3.02 Assuming two air changes per hour in a room con- taining 8000 ft3 we have �6.9 lb of water per hour required.

ANVIL® PIPE FITTERS HANDBOOK 8 Gruvlok® Installation and assembly Figure 7011 Standard Coupling 1. Pipe Preparation Inspect the pipe ends making sure the criteria, in the Gruvlok Large Diameter Pipe Roll and Cut Groove Specifications, are met. 2. Gasket Installation Turn the gasket inside out and slide the gasket completely over one of the pipe ends. Turning the gasket inside out will reduce the stretching necessary to put the gasket into position. Ideally, approximately 75% of the pipe’s gasket-sealing surface, (Dimension A) should be visible when the gasket is in proper position. This will aid in step 4. 3. Lubricate Gasket Lubricate the gasket sealing lips. The use of Gruvlok lubricants ensures compatibil- ity between the lubricant and the gasket. 4. Alignment Pull the two pipes into contact aligning the pipe ends. CAUTION: Be careful not to pinch fingers during this step. Working your way around the circumference of the pipe, flip the gasket toward the pipe end so that the proper side is facing out. The end of this procedure will result in the gasket snapping into place. Position the gasket centrally between the grooves of the two pipe ends. 5. Lubricate Gasket Lubricate the exterior surface of the gasket. This helps prevent pinching of the gasket during assembly. 6. Housings Secure the housings about the pipes making sure the coupling keys are engaged in the pipe end grooves. Hint: For horizontal assembly, place housing segment on top of the pipe to support the weight of the housing segment. Secure the adjacent housing with an oval neck track bolt and heavy hex nut and then rotate the secured housings, again balancing the weight of the housings on the top of the pipe. Continue this procedure for all segments. APFH-4.13

When mating to a wafer valve (lug valve), if the valve is rubber faced in the area designated by the sealing surface dimensions (A Max. to B Min.), place the Gruvlok Flange Adapter Insert between the valve and the Gruvlok Flange. 2. When mating to a rubber-faced metal flange, the Gruvlok Flange Adapter Insert is placed between the Gruvlok Flange and the rubber-faced flange. 3. When mating to a serrated flange surface, a standard full-faced flange gasket is installed against the serrated flange face, and the Gruvlok Flange Adapter Insert is placed between the Gruvlok Flange and the standard flange gasket. 4. When mating to valves or other component equipment where the flange face has an insert, use procedure described in note 3. Gruvlok® Installation and assembly Figure 7012 Flange (2" – 12") Applications which require a Gruvlok Flange Adapter Insert: Check pipe end for proper grooved dimensions and to assure that the pipe end is free of indentations and projections that would prevent proper sealing of the Gruvlok flange gasket. 1. Install Housings On the side without the hinge pin, loosen the latch bolt nut to the end of the bolt thread. (It is not necessary to remove the nut from the latch bolt.) Swing the latch bolt out of the slot. Open the Gruvlok Flange and place around the grooved pipe end with the key section fitting into the groove. The flange gasket cavity must face the pipe end. 2. Latch Housings Place the latch bolt back into the slotted hole. Tighten the nut until there is a 1/16" gap between the flange halves at location “A”. (See Figure below) 3. Check & Lubricate Gasket Check the gasket to assure that it is properly suited for the intended service. Lubricate the entire exterior surface of the gasket, including the sealing lips, using the proper Gruvlok lubricant. The Gruvlok Flange gasket must be inserted so that the sealing lips face toward the pipe end and the mating flange. The lip of the gasket, sealing on the pipe, should not extend beyond the pipe end. The pipe should extend out beyond the end of the sealing lip by approximately 1/8" on the 2"-6" sizes and 3/16" on the 8"-12" sizes.

The Flange Adapter Insert will be exposed to the fluids in the system. Ensure that the Insert is compatible with the fluids in the systems and with adjacent piping components. 4. Install Gasket Stretch the Gruvlok gasket around the pipe end and then press the gasket into the cavity between the pipe O.D. and the flange. The gasket must be properly positioned as shown in the figure below. Gruvlok® Installation and assembly Figure 7012 Flange (2" – 12") Continued CAUTION: Proper torquing of flange bolts is required to obtain specified performance. Over torquing the bolts may result in damage to the bolt and/or casting which could result in pipe joint separation. Under torquing the bolts may result in lower pressure retention capabilities, lower bend load capabilities, joint leakage and pipe joint separation. Pipe joint separation may result in significant property damage and serious injury. CAUTION: Use of an impact wrench is not recommended because the torque output can vary significantly due to many variables including air pressure supply, battery strength and operational variations. 5. Lubricate Gasket Lip With the gasket in place apply lubricant to the exposed gasket tip, which will seal on the mating flange. Tighten the nuts on the latch bolts alternately to the specified latch bolt torque.* The flange housings must be in firm metal-to-metal contact. * Refer to page 28 with bolt torque table 6. Inspect Mating Flange Verify that the mating flange face is hard, flat and smooth, free of indentations, which would prevent proper sealing of the Gruvlok Flange gasket. Assure the gasket is still in the proper position and align Gruvlok Flange bolt holes with the mating flange, pump, tank, etc., bolt holes. It is important to line up the bolt holes before bringing the two flanges together. Sliding the flanges into place will dislodge the gasket and cause leakage to occur. When using a flange insert, it is important that the insert is properly aligned with the gasket prior to tightening the bolts. WARNING 7. Install Bolting Insert a flange bolt or stud with material properties of SAE J429 Grade 5 or higher through the bolt holes and thread a nut on hand tight. Continue this procedure until all bolt holes have been fitted. Tighten the nuts alternately and evenly so the flange faces remain parallel. All the bolts or studs must be torqued to the mating flange bolts specified torque. The flange faces should have metal-to-metal contact. Do not use a steel Flange Adapter Insert in copper systems or in systems where galvanic corrosion is possible. Fig. C1 Fig. C2 WARNING APFH-4.13

Pull the two flanges into contact using care to assure that the gasket remains fully seated within the gasket cavity during assembly. NOTE: Take care to assure that the gasket lip is not bent backwards and pinched between the two flanges. 1 Place each Gruvlok Flange segment around the grooved pipe with the key section fitting into the groove and the flange gasket cavity facing the pipe end. Loosely assemble the segments using the four segment-bolts-and nuts. Alternately and equally tighten the latch bolts and nuts to the specified latch bolt torque. Bring the four flange segments into full, firm metal-to-metal contact. NOTE: An alternative method of assembly is to loosely preassemble two segments into two equal halves of the flange leaving a small gap (approximately 1/8") between the two segments of each flange- half. Place the flange halves around the pipe and complete the assembly as described in Step 1, above. Gruvlok® Installation and assembly Figure 7012 Flange (14" – 24") CAUTION: Proper torquing of flange bolts is required to obtain specified performance. Over torquing the bolts may result in damage to the bolt and/or casting which could result in pipe joint separation. Under torquing the bolts may result in lower pressure retention capabilities, lower bend load capabilities, joint leakage and pipe joint separation. Pipe joint separation may result in significant property damage and serious injury. CAUTION: Use of an impact wrench is not recommended because the torque output can vary significantly due to many variables including air pressure supply, battery strength and operational variations. Gruvlok® Flanges of 14" size and larger are cast in four segments to ease handling during assembly. Figure 7012 Gruvlok Flanges should not be used with tie rods nor in a configuration with a wafer valve between two 7012 flanges. 2 Check the gasket grade to verify that it is properly suited for the intended service. Lubricate the entire surface of the gasket and the flange cavity using the appropriate Gruvlok Lubricant. Place the Gruvlok Flange Gasket around the pipe end by pressing the gasket into the cavity between the pipe O.D. and flange recess. Move around the gasket in both directions until the gasket is fully seated in the flange gasket cavity. 3 The correct position and relationship of the components of the Gruvlok Flange assembly is shown in the Figure above. The wide gasket lip must seal on the pipe surface diameter and the narrow gasket lip must face the mating flange. Be careful that foreign particles do not adhere to lubricated surfaces. NOTE: Design of the Gruvlok Flange provides sealing only with the special Gruvlok Flange gasket. Only Gruvlok Flange gaskets may be used with Fig. 7012 flanges.

27 ANVIL® PIPE FITTERS HANDBOOK Gruvlok Installation Pipe and Flange Data Weld Fitting and Steel Flange Data Table of Contents Gruvlok Tech. Data Bolt Templates General Welding Information Conversions Drop Nipple and Tee-Let Installation Pipe Thread Standards Gruvlok® Technical Data Gruvlok Lubricants GRUVLOK® XTREMETM LUBRICANT Gruvlok® Xtreme™ Lubricant has been developed for use with Gruvlok couplings in services where improved lubrication is beneficial. This lubricant has an operating temperature range from -65°F to 400°F (-53.8°C to 204°C), well exceeding the temperature range of Gruvlok gaskets. This lubricant is waterproof, thereby eliminating water wash-out and it will not dry out in the absence of water. There are five primary applications where the Xtreme Lubricant will provide increased benefits: low temperature applications below -20°F(-28.0°C), high temperature applications above 150°F (65.6°C), applications where increased pipe joint flexibility is needed, lubrication of gaskets in copper systems, and for the lubrication of gaskets on HDPE couplings. Since it is formulated from a non-hydro carbon base, it can be used with EPDM, Nitrile and Fluoroelastomer gasket materials. It is not to be used with Silicone gaskets. • In low temperature applications the gasket will shrink, thereby lowering the sealing force on the gasket sealing lips. The temperature change will also force the gasket to slightly re-position itself. This will cause pipe end sealing surfaces, with small cuts or damage, to become more susceptible to leakage. Gruvlok Xtreme Lubricant will maintain its lubricating properties at lower temperatures allowing a properly lubricated pipe end and gasket (assembly) to reposition itself during temperature cycles. • For high temperature service and copper systems, it is required that the gasket be lubricated not only on the outside, as with the normal installation of a Gruvlok gasket, but also on the inside. Lubrication on the inside of the gasket is easily accomplished by turning the gasket inside out and applying the lubricant. Gruvlok Xtreme Lubricant will maintain its lubricating properties at higher temperatures, allowing a properly lubricated pipe end and gasket assembly to re-position itself during temperature cycles. Lubrication of the pipe end and gasket will help the gasket to adjust into the proper sealing position during temperature cycles. The lubricant on the interior of the gasket will act to improve the chemical resistance of the gasket material by providing a thin lubricant barrier between the piping system fluid and the gasket surface. This is particularly important at higher temperatures where oxidizing agents in the piping system become more aggressive. However, gasket chemical compatibility must still be considered. • The Gruvlok Xtreme Lubricant has been formulated from low viscosity, non-petroleum based oils to ease spreading of the lubricant. In applications where pipe movement is expected, proper lubrication of the gasket’s exterior assists the gasket into the proper sealing position as pipe system movement occurs. This lubricating film enhances our flexible coupling gasket’s ability to compensate for axial, transverse and rotational pipe movements. • Gruvlok Xtreme Lubricant is the only Gruvlok lubricant that is to be used with Gruvlok couplings and gaskets in HDPE and copper piping systems. It’s low temperature capability and lubricity ensure a highly reliable connection. Gruvlok® XtremeTM Lubricant is a Teflon® fortified white, tasteless and odorless grease made from Silicone Oil and other ingredients that are safe to ingest. It is sanctioned by the FDA under C.F.R. 21.172.878 & 21.177.1550 (Incidental Food Contact). It is NSF approved for use with potable water. CAUTION: Silicone based lubricants are not allowed in some facilities. Do not use with CPVC Products. ®Teflon is a registered trademark of Dupont. APFH-12.11

ANVIL® PIPE FITTERS HANDBOOK 28 Gruvlok® Technical Data Gruvlok Lubricants Continued GRUVLOK® QUICK DRY LUBRICANT Gruvlok® Quick Dry Lubricant is a fast drying lubricant that has been developed for applications where the piping system is exposed. The service temperature range for this lubricant is from 0° F to 150° F (-17.8°C to 65.6°C) and may be used with all Gruvlok gasket material grades. The lubricant is made from a water emulsion that is non-toxic, it will not impart taste or odor, and does not support bacterial growth. Gruvlok Quick Dry Lubricant is non-corrosive, non-flammable, and is NSF approved for use with potable water. This lubricant is easy to apply by brush or hand, and it quickly dries to a thin film when in contact with air. It is water-soluble. The quick drying quality of the lubricant eliminates lubricant drips caused by over lubrication. If necessary, reapply lubricant prior to assembly. Do not thin or mix with solvents. GRUVLOK® LUBRICANT Gruvlok® Lubricant is the standard lubricant that has been provided for use with Gruvlok products for years. Gruvlok Lubricant is water soluble, non-toxic, non-corrosive, non-flammable, and will not impart taste or odor. It is NSF approved for use with potable water. This lubricant is acceptable for most applications, however, the Gruvlok Xtreme Lubricant and Gruvlok Quick Dry Lubricant are now available to improve the performance of the couplings and flanges in certain applications. CAUTION: HDPE pipe requires the use of Gruvlok Xtreme Lubricant and should not be used with Gruvlok Lubricant. Specified Bolt Torque Specified bolt torque is for the oval neck track bolts used on Gruvlok couplings and flanges. The nuts must be tightened alternately and evenly until fully tightened. CAUTION: Use of an Impact wrench is not recommended because the torque output can vary significantly due to many variables including air pressure supply, battery strength and operational variations. CAUTION: Proper torquing of coupling bolts is required to obtain specified performance. Over torquing the bolts may result in damage to the bolt and/or casting which could result in pipe joint separation. Under torquing the bolts may result in lower pressure retention capabilities, lower bend load capabilities, joint leakage and pipe joint separation. Pipe joint separation may result in significant property damage and serious injury. NOTE: Use specified bolt torque unless otherwise indicated on product installation pages.

The required pipe preparation may be grooving or cleaning the pipe ends, or cutting a hole in the pipe wall. For grooved-end joints, pipe may be grooved by either of two methods; cut or roll grooving. Branch outlet connections require a properly sized and correctly located hole to be cut into the pipe. Sock-it connections require cleaning of the pipe end. Gruvlok plain-end pipe couplings require that the pipe be free of burrs and other sharp projections which could damage the gasket; grooving is not required. Gruvlok pipe grooving and hole cutting machines are available in a wide variety of designs to meet specific or general requirements. Gruvlok roll grooving machines produce a groove to proper dimensional tolerances, concentric with the pipe O.D., even on out-of-round pipe. Gruvlok hole cutting tools properly center holes for correct assembly of Gruvlok branch outlet components. Cut-Grooving: Cut grooving is intended for use with standard and heavier wall pipe. Cut grooving produces a groove in the pipe wall by removing metal from the pipe O.D. The groove removes less than one half of the pipe wall and does not cut as deeply into the pipe wall as do standard pipe threads. The square cut edge of the groove allows for the full expansion, contraction, and deflection capabilities of the Gruvlok coupling. Cut Grooving Depth of Cut Groove vs. Thread Volume of Metal Removed Cut Groove vs. Threaded Roll-Grooving: Roll grooving does not remove metal. Instead, metal is displaced while a groove is formed into the outer surface of the pipe wall. The groove configuration has slightly rounded edges resulting in a less flexible joint than a cut groove joint. This reduces available pipe joint movement by 50% over cut grooved coupling joints. Roll grooving is commonly used on a wide range of pipe thicknesses up to 0.375" wall steel pipe and sizes to 24" O.D. Roll Grooving The I.D. “dimple" formed from roll grooving reduces the I.D. (on an average) less than 2%. Roll Groove Cut Groove Available Movement Roll Groove vs. Cut Groove APFH-12.11 Gruvlok® Technical Data Pipe Preparation

ANVIL® PIPE FITTERS HANDBOOK 30 Branch Outlet Pipe: Clamp-T® Clamp-T installations require the cutting of a hole through the pipe wall. The hole must be properly sized and located on the centerline of the pipe to assure reliable performance of the Clamp-T gaskets. After the hole has been cut into the pipe wall, any burrs and sharp or rough edges must be removed from the hole. The outside pipe surfaces within 5/8" of the hole must be clean and smooth. Any scale, projections or indentation which might effect the gasket sealing on the pipe must be removed. The surface around the entire circumference of the pipe within the “A” dimension in the charts must be free from dirt, scale, or projections which might effect the proper assembly of the Clamp-T.

Pipe ends (plain or beveled end) must be square cut as measured from a true square line with the maximum allowable tolerance as follows: 0.030" (0.7 mm) for 2" through 3"; 0.045 (1.1 mm) for 4" through 6"; and 0.060" (1.5 mm) for 8" sizes. The nominal outside diameter of pipe should not vary more than 1% for sizes up to 21/2", +1%-1/32" for sizes 3"-5"; +1/16"-1/32" for sizes 6" and larger. Pipe ends must be marked a distance of 1" from the pipe end for Sizes 2"-4" and 11/4" from the pipe end for Sizes 5"-8" as a guide for centering of the gasket on the pipe ends.

The maximum available angular movement of Gruvlok flexible couplings on roll groove joints is shown in the performance data for each coupling. The amount of angular flexibility varies for each coupling size and type. The values account for pipe, groove, and coupling tolerances. FLEXIBLE COUPLING LINEAR MOVEMENT Linear movement is accommodated within the coupling by allowing the pipe ends to move together or apart in response to pressure thrusts and temperature changes. The available linear movement provided by Standard Gruvlok couplings is shown below: linear movement: RIGID COUPLINGS Gruvlok rigid couplings Fig. 7400, Fig. 7401 and Fig. 7004 HPR are designed to provide a joint with the attributes of a welded or flanged connection. Therefore, these joints would remain in strict alignment and would resist deflection and linear movement during service. FLEXIBLE COUPLINGS Figs. 7000, 7001, 7003, 7010 are the flexible couplings provided in the Gruvlok product line. The following information on movement applies to these flexible couplings. Represents Linear Movement Capabilities θ θ/2 DESIGN FACTORS Gruvlok® Couplings MOVEMENT Each flexible design Gruvlok coupling can provide for pipe system movement up to the design maximum for the specific size and type coupling being utilized. Movement is possible in the Gruvlok coupling due to two factors: (1) designed-in clearance between the key of the coupling and the groove diameter and groove width, and (2) the gap between pipe ends joined by the coupling. angular movement: APFH-12.11

ANVIL® PIPE FITTERS HANDBOOK 40 A sufficient amount of coupling joints must be provided to accommodate the calculated movement (expansion or contraction) in a pipe run or segment thereof . Example: A 200 foot long straight run of 4" steel cut grooved pipe between anchor points. Minimum Temperature: 40° F (4 .4° C) (at time of installation) . Maximum Oper . Temperature: 160° F (71 .1° C) . Thermal expansion tables show this system will expand a total of 1 .80" due to the temperature change . DesiGn QuesTion How many couplings are required to account for the thermal growth? available linear movemenT per fleXible couplinG: Using the table on page 39, we see that there is 0 .188" linear movement per coupling (4" Flexible Coupling) couplinGs reQuireD As indicated above, the total movement is 1 .80". Thus, the number of couplings is determined as follows: No . of Couplings = Tot . Movement / Avail . Movement per Coupling for our eXample: No . of Couplings = (1 .80") / (0 .187") = 9 .6, Therefore 10 couplings are needed 200 FEET MOVEMENT - APPLICATIONS Gruvlok® Couplings posiTion of couplinGs In order for the couplings to provide for the movement indicated by the above example, it would be necessary to install all couplings with the maximum gap between pipe ends. Conversely, if the thermal movement was contraction due to a reduction of system temperature, the coupling joints would have be installed with the pipe ends butted, thus accommodating the “shrink” of the pipe system. thermal movement The clearance in the grooved coupling joint, will allow a limited capability for combined linear and angular movement. A partially deflected joint will not provide full linear movement capability. A fully deflected coupling joint provides no linear movement capability. The Gruvlok coupling will not allow for both maximum linear and maximum angular movement simultaneously. In systems where both are expected, additional joints may be required.

Data Bolt Templates General Welding Information Conversions Drop Nipple and Tee-Let Installation Pipe Thread Standards DRAINAGE, BURIED SYSTEMS, ETC The flexible design of the Gruvlok coupling makes it ideal for use in a wide variety of systems in which random changes of the pipe direction can be accommodated by the Gruvlok coupling’s angular deflection capability rather than requiring the use of special fittings. Pitched drainage systems, buried pipe systems where pipe laying conditions are subject to settlement, and exposed pipe systems laid on rough ground are but a few of the many types of pipe installations that present conditions where the functional capability of the Gruvlok coupling are useful. MOVEMENT - APPLICATIONS Gruvlok® Couplings Pitched for Drainage Buried Pipe Systems CURVE LAYOUT NOTE: Fully Deflected Joint Will Not Allow For Linear Expansion. In the example above, two couplings were added to account for thermal expansion and the other couplings accommodate only the misalignment. The additional stress from the combined movement is therefore relieved. ROTATIONAL MOVEMENT: Piping systems designed with Gruvlok Couplings can accommodate minor rotational movement from thermal expansion, settlement, vibration, or other similar movements. However, Gruvlok Couplings should never be used as a continuous swivel joint. For Deflection For Expansion Utilizing the rotational capability of the Gruvlok Coupling, the pipe life of a slurry or similar coarse material piping system can be extended. For pipe rotation, the system must be shut down and internal pressure relieved. The pipe may then be rotated one-quarter turn, the couplings retightened, and service resumed. If performed on a regular basis, pipe rotation will evenly distribute wear over the entire inner surface of the pipe.

It is interesting to note that the formula uses the “outside diameter” of pipe and is sometimes referred to as the “outside diameter formula.” P = (2 • t • S) / D Where: P = internal units pressure, in psi S = unit stress, in psi D = outside diameter of pipe, in inches t = wall thickness, in inches Barlow's Formula Standard Weight Pipe Data Nominal Pipe Diameter (Inches) Actual Inside Diameter (Inches) Actual Outside Diameter (Inches) Weight per Foot (Pounds) Length in Feet containing One Cubic Foot (Feet) Gallons in One Linear Foot (Gallons) 1⁄8 0.269 0.405 0.245 2,526.000 0.0030 1⁄4 0.364 0.540 0.425 1,383.800 0.0054 3⁄8 0.493 0.675 0.568 754.360 0.0099 1⁄2 0.622 0.840 0.851 473.910 0.0158 3⁄4 0.824 1.050 1.131 270.030 0.0277 1 1.049 1.315 1.679 166.620 0.0449 11⁄4 1.380 1.660 2.273 96.275 0.0777 11⁄2 1.610 1.900 2.718 70.733 0.1058 2 2.067 2.375 3.653 49.913 0.1743 21⁄2 2.469 2.875 5.793 30.077 0.2487 3 3.068 3.500 7.580 19.479 0.3840 31⁄2 3.548 4.000 9.110 14.565 0.5136 4 4.026 4.500 10.790 11.312 0.6613 5 5.047 5.563 14.620 7.198 1.0393 6 6.065 6.625 18.970 4.984 1.5008 8 7.981 8.625 28.550 2.878 2.5988 10 10.020 10.750 40.480 1.826 4.0963 APFH-12.11

Data Bolt Templates General Welding Information Conversions Drop Nipple and Tee-Let Installation Pipe Thread Standards NOTES: 1. In plan or elevation, near, far, and both sides, locations refer to nearest member parallel to plane of drawing and not to others farther behind. 2. In section or end views only, when weld is not drawn, the side to which arrow points is considered near side. 3. Welds on both sides are of same size unless otherwise shown. 4. Symbols govern to break in continuity of structure or to extent of hatching or dimension lines. 5. Tail of arrow used for specification reference. 6. All welds are continuous and of user's standard propertions and all except V-grooved and bevel-grooved welds are closed unless otherwise shown. 7. When welds are drawn in section or end views, obvious information is not given by symbol. 8. In joints in which one member only is to be grooved, arrows point to that member. Basic Arc & Gas Welding Symbols Notes NOTES: 1. Size, weld symbol, length of weld and spacing must read in that order from left to right along the reference line. Neither orientation of reference line nor location of the arrow alter this rule. 2. The perpendicular leg of , , , weld symbols must be at left. 3. Arrow and other side welds are of the same size unless otherwise shown. Dimensions of fillet welds must be shown on both the arrow side and other side symbol. 4. The point of the field weld symbol must point toward the tail. 5. Symbols apply between abrupt changes in direction of welding unless governed by the “All Around” symbol or otherwise dimensioned.

B) Prior to installing the sprinkler, count the number of fully developed male threads on the brand of sprinkler to be installed. If seven (7) perfect threads are counted, the sprinkler should thread into the 1⁄2" or 3⁄4" thread from three (3) to four (4) threads hand tight. If five (5) to six (6) threads are counted, the sprinkler should thread into the 1⁄2" or 3⁄4" thread from two (2) to three (3) threads hand tight. C) The use of an anaerobic pipe thread sealant is preferred for thread make up when connecting to another pipe fitting or nipple. If attaching a sprinkler head, please refer to the manufacturer’s installation instructions and apply pipe thread sealant only to male threads of the sprinkler. D) If either of the above fails to allow the sprinkler to make-up to a minimum of five (5) to six (6) full threads, do not overtighten the sprinkler. Instead back the sprinkler out of the fitting. Clean any debris and/or pipe sealant from both the male and female threads. Gauge both the male threads of the sprinkler and the female threads of the Adjustable Drop Nipple for compliance with ASME B1.20.1. Specification for Tapered Pipe Threads. The same procedure would apply if a leak has been detected. If within tolerance, reapply the anaerobic pipe sealant and assemble to the required length. Allow twenty-four hours for setting. E) Connect the Adjustable Drop Nipple assembly to the sprinkler system by wrenching on the make-up area on the Drop Nipple. DO NOT WRENCH ON THE BARREL PORTION OF THE UNIT OR SPRINKLER. Damage to the Adjustable Drop Nipple or Sprinkler may result. F) After the ceiling has been installed adjust the sprinkler to its final position by using the sprinkler wrench and assemble the escutcheon plate to the inner support ring. It is recommended that the system pressure be relieved when adjusting, however it is not necessary to drain the system.

Note: Tee-Lets are manufactured to fit size-on-size, that is the contoured shape on a given Tee-Let is made to fit perfectly on the first listed header size. If installed on the second header size marked on the fitting, a slight gap of approximately 1⁄32" will appear along the longitudinal centerline of the header. For example, a 1" x 2 - 21⁄2" Tee-Let, is a 1" outlet fitting manufactured to fit perfectly on the 2" header size listed, while leaving a 1⁄32" gap along the longitudinal centerline of the 21⁄2" size. If a perfect fit is required for a 21⁄2" header pipe, then a 1" x 21⁄2 - 3" Tee-Let would be ordered. Size consolidations are employed to reduce inventory and provide for greater flexibility. Thread Make-up and Installation A) For use in systems installed in accordance with all applicable standards or codes. (See Section III, Item C) B) Prior to installing sprinkler, ensure that no dirt, weld spatter or damage is in the threads. Then count the number of fully developed male threads on the nipple or sprinkler to be installed into the fittings. Compare number of threads counted to the number of required fully developed threads as shown in the thread chart located on the back of this sheet. If thread count is correct, proceed with installation (Step C), if thread count does not match, check nipple or sprinkler for proper thread gage measurement and discard if not to ASME B1.20.1 C) The use of an anaerobic pipe thread sealant is preferred for thread make up when con- necting to another pipe fitting or nipple. If attaching a sprinkler head, please refer to the manufacturer’s installation instructions and apply pipe thread sealant only to male threads of the sprinkler. D) If either of the above fails to allow the sprinkler or nipple to assemble to a minimum of full threads, do not over tighten. Instead back the sprinkler or nipple out of the fitting. Clean any debris and/or pipe sealant from both the male and female threads. Gauge both the male threads of the sprinkler or nipple and the female threads of the Tee-Let for compliance with ASME B1.20.1. Specification for Tapered Pipe Threads. The same procedure would apply if a leak has been detected.

Data Bolt Templates General Welding Information Conversions Drop Nipple and Tee-Let Installation Pipe Thread Standards Recommended Hole Sizes The hole cut in the branch or header pipe can be cut prior or subsequent to attachment of the Tee-Let. One advantage of cutting the hole after welding is that the pipe is left intact during welding thereby reducing shrinkage and possible distortion. If holes are cut prior to welding, as some codes require, then the following hole sizes are recommended.

Merit offers a simple approach to cutting the hole. Hand-held templates are sized to match your plasma cutter. Installation and assembly Merit® Weld-Miser™ Tee-Let (Welding Outlet Fittings) Recommended Welding Procedures As a general rule, the weld should be only as hot as required to allow the weld to penetrate the materials being welded while concomitantly allowing gases developed in the welding process to escape. Every effort must be made to avoid welding too hot or overheating both the pipe and the Tee-Let. Excessive heat may cause the wrench tight threads (those in the bottom of the Tee-Let near the weld zone) to distort while also causing the branch pipe to bend. It should be noted that Merit Tee-Lets have been subjected to exhaustive testing and evaluation, and only negligibly distort when subjected to excessive heat. The threads, on the other hand, may not return to their gauged form after cooling if excessive heat causes them to expand. The following is intended only as a guide, and assumes that the welding equipment is properly calibrated and functioning normally and the operator is qualified. APFH-4.13

Data Bolt Templates General Welding Information Conversions Drop Nipple and Tee-Let Installation Pipe Thread Standards 1) Inspect both male and female components prior to assembly. • Threads should be free from mechanical damage, dirt, chips and excess cutting oil. • Clean or replace components as necessary. 2) Application of pipe dope • Use a pipe dope that is fast drying, sets-up to a semi hard condition and is vibration resistant. Alternately, an anaerobic sealant may be utilized. • Thoroughly mix the thread sealant prior to application. • Apply a thick even coat to the male threads only. Best application is achieved with a brush stiff enough to force sealant down to the root of the threads. 3) Joint Makeup • For sizes up to and including 2" pipe, wrench tight makeup is considered three full turns past handtight. Handtight engagement for 1⁄2" through 2" thread varies from 41⁄2 turns to 5 turns. • For 21⁄2" through 4" sizes, wrench tight makeup is considered two full turns past handtight.

81 ANVIL® PIPE FITTERS HANDBOOK Forged Steel & Oil Country Fitting Data Beam Dimensions Hanger Spacing & Hanger Product General Information Gruvlok® Pipe Support When designing the hangers, supports and anchors for a grooved-end pipe system, the piping designer must consider certain unique characteristics of the grooved type coupling in addition to many universal pipe hanger and support design factors. As with any pipe system, the hanger or support system must provide for 1) the weight of the pipe, couplings, fluid & pipe system components; 2) reduce stresses at pipe joints; and 3) permit required pipe system movement to relieve stress. The following factors should be considered when designing hangers and supports for a grooved-end pipe system. Pipe Hanger Spacing: The following charts show the maximum span between pipe hangers for straight runs of standard weight steel pipe filled with water or other similar fluids. Do not use these values where critical span calculations are made or where there are concentrated loads between supports.

The possibility of temperature overrides beyond regular working temperatures and cost may either make either of the alternatives more desirable. This chart based on continuous spans and for un-insulated line carrying fluids of specific gravity up to 1.00. The above table is meant as a general guideline, it is recommended that the pipe manufacturer be consulted for specific spacing recommendations relating to their pipe, load conditions, operating temperature and service conditions. Local codes and specifications may also vary from the above recommended spacing and should be consulted for the applicable spacing requirements prior to installation. APFH-12.11

The possibility of temperature overrides beyond regular working temperatures and cost may either make either of the alternatives more desirable. This chart based on continuous spans and for un-insulated line carrying fluids of specific gravity up to 1.00. The above table is meant as a general guideline, it is recommended that the pipe manufacturer be consulted for specific spacing recommendations relating to their pipe, load conditions, operating temperature and service conditions. Local codes and specifications may also vary from the above recommended spacing and should be consulted for the applicable spacing requirements prior to installation. APFH-12.11

HOW TO USE THIS HANDBOOK As with any handbook, the user of this handbook can seek the topic covered either with the help of the table of contents or the index. However, an understanding of the organization and the format of this handbook will enhance its utility. The handbook is organized in five parts: Part A, Piping Fundamentals: There are ten chapters in Part A, numbered Al through A10, dealing with commonly used terminology associated with piping units—U.S. Customary units and metric/SI units, piping components, materials, piping codes and standards, manufacturing of piping, fabrication and installation of piping, bolted joints, prestressed concrete piping, and grooved and Pressfit piping systems, Each chapter is a self-contained unit. The chapter numbers, figures and tables sequentially preceded. For example, in the case of Chapter Al, the figures are numbered as Fig. A1.1, Fig. A1.2, and so on, and tables are numbered as Table A1.1, Table A1.2, and so on. Pages are numbered sequentially throughout each part, starting with A.1. Part B, Generic Design Considerations: The Part B consists of fourteen chapters. The topics covered deal with generic design considerations, which may be applicable to any piping system irrespective of the fluid or the mixture carried by the piping. The generic topics are design documents, design bases, piping layout, stress analysis, piping supports, heat tracing, thermal insulation, and flow of fluids. In addition, the lined piping systems: cement, rubber, epoxy and plastic lined piping systems are included to provide guidance when corrosion is a concern. A chapter on double containment piping systems provides needed guidance to handle hazardous fluids. The last chapter in Part B deals with pressure testing of piping systems. The chapter, page, figure, and table numbering scheme is similar to that described for Part A. Part C, Piping Systems: There are 17 chapters in Part C, each dealing with a specific type of piping system or systems involving application of specific considera- tions. The piping systems covered include water, fire protection, steam, building services, oil, gas, chemical and refinery (process piping), cryogenic, refrigeration, toxic and hazardous wastes, slurry and sludge, stormwater and wastewater, plumb- ing, ash handling, compressed air and vacuum, fuel gas and laboratory piping systems. The numbering approach for Part C is similar to Part A. Part D, Nonmetallic Piping: Part D has two chapters, Dl and D2. Chapter Dl addresses thermoplastics piping, and Chapter D2 covers fiberglass piping systems. The numbering scheme for pages, figures, and tables is similar to the one followed for Part A. Part E, Appendixes: Part E of the handbook contains reference technical data and information that could be very handy and useful to the users. It consists of 10 appendixes, El through E10. They include conversion tables, pipe and tube proper- ties, pressure drop tables, ASTM and international piping materials, fluid properties, piping related computer programs, and an exhaustive list of international standards. Depending upon the need, level of piping knowledge, and requirements, the xix

xx HOW TO USE THIS HANDBOOK user of this handbook may find it very convenient to locate the desired information by focusing on a specific part of the handbook. Last but not least, the Seventh Edition of Piping Handbook includes metric/SI units in parentheses. The values stated in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must be used independently of the other. At times, unit equivalents are rounded off while at places they are approximated to provide a measure of equivalency. Different approaches have been followed depending upon the practices prevalent in a segment of the piping industry. We regret the variations and expect the users to understand the state of the art in regard to use of units. The users are cautioned to check and verify units prior to making calculations with the help of equations included in the handbook or elsewhere.

## P ● A ● R ● T ● A PIPING FUNDAMENTALS

CHAPTER A1 INTRODUCTION TO PIPING Mohinder L Nayyar, P. E. ASME Fellow Bechtel Power Corporation INTRODUCTION Piping systems are like arteries and veins. They carry the lifeblood of modern civilization. In a modern city they transport water from the sources of water supply to the points of distribution; convey waste from residential and commercial buildings and other civic facilities to the treatment facility or the point of discharge. Similarly, pipelines carry crude oil from oil wells to tank farms for storage or to refineries for processing. The natural gas transportation and distribution lines convey natural gas from the source and storage tank forms to points of utilization, such as power plants, industrial facilities, and commercial and residential communities. In chemical plants, paper mills, food processing plants, and other similar industrial establish- ments, the piping systems are utilized to carry liquids, chemicals, mixtures, gases, vapors, and solids from one location to another. The fire protection piping networks in residential, commercial, industrial, and other buildings carry fire suppression fluids, such as water, gases, and chemicals to provide protection of life and property. The piping systems in thermal power plants convey high-pressure and high-temperature steam to generate electricity. Other piping systems in a power plant transport high- and low-pressure water, chemicals, low-pressure steam, and condensate. Sophisticated piping systems are used to pro- cess and carry hazardous and toxic substances. The storm and wastewater piping systems transport large quantities of water away from towns, cities, and industrial and similar establishments to safeguard life, property, and essential facilities. In health facilities, piping systems are used to transport gases and fluids for medical purposes. The piping systems in laboratories carry gases, chemicals, vapors, and other fluids that are critical for conducting research and development. In short, the piping systems are an essential and integral part of our modern civilization just as arteries and veins are essential to the human body. The design, construction, operation, and maintenance of various piping systems involve understanding of piping fundamentals, materials, generic and specific design considerations, fabrication and installation, examinations, and testing and inspection requirements, in addition to the local, state and federal regulations.

A.4 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS PIPING Piping includes pipe, flanges, fittings, bolting, gaskets, valves, and the pressure- containing portions of other piping components. It also includes pipe hangers and supports and other items necessary to prevent overpressurization and overstressing of the pressure-containing components. It is evident that pipe is one element or a part of piping. Therefore, pipe sections when joined with fittings, valves, and other mechanical equipment and properly supported by hangers and supports, are called piping. Pipe Pipe is a tube with round cross section conforming to the dimensional require- ments of ●ASME B36.10M Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe ●ASME B36.19M Stainless Steel Pipe Pipe Size Initially a system known as iron pipe size (IPS) was established to designate the pipe size. The size represented the approximate inside diameter of the pipe in inches. An IPS 6 pipe is one whose inside diameter is approximately 6 inches (in). Users started to call the pipe as 2-in, 4-in, 6-in pipe and so on. To begin, each pipe size was produced to have one thickness, which later was termed as standard (STD) or standard weight (STD. WT.). The outside diameter of the pipe was standardized. As the industrial requirements demanded the handling of higher-pressure fluids, pipes were produced having thicker walls, which came to be known as extra strong (XS) or extra heavy (XH). The higher pressure requirements increased further, requiring thicker wall pipes. Accordingly, pipes were manufactured with double extra strong (XXS) or double extra heavy (XXH) walls while the standardized outside diameters are unchanged. With the development of stronger and corrosion-resistant piping materials, the need for thinner wall pipe resulted in a new method of specifying pipe size and wall thickness. The designation known as nominal pipe size (NPS) replaced IPS, and the term schedule (SCH) was invented to specify the nominal wall thickness of pipe. Nominal pipe size (NPS) is a dimensionless designator of pipe size. It indicates standard pipe size when followed by the specific size designation number without an inch symbol. For example, NPS 2 indicates a pipe whose outside diameter is 2.375 in. The NPS 12 and smaller pipe has outside diameter greater than the size designator (say, 2, 4, 6, . . .). However, the outside diameter of NPS 14 and larger pipe is the same as the size designator in inches. For example, NPS 14 pipe has an outside diameter equal to 14 in. The inside diameter will depend upon the pipe wall thickness specified by the schedule number. Refer to ASME B36.10M or ASME B36.19M. Refer to App. E2 or E2M. Diameter nominal (DN) is also a dimensionless designator of pipe size in the metric unit system, developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO). It indicates standard pipe size when followed by the specific size designation number

For sizes larger than NPS 80, determine the DN equivalent by multiplying NPS size designation number by 25. without a millimeter symbol. For example, DN 50 is the equivalent designation of NPS 2. Refer to Table A1.1 for NPS and DN pipe size equivalents. Pipe Wall Thickness Schedule is expressed in numbers (5, 5S, 10, 10S, 20, 20S, 30, 40, 40S, 60, 80, 80S, 100, 120, 140, 160). A schedule number indicates the approximate value of the expression 1000 P/S, where P is the service pressure and S is the allowable stress, both expressed in pounds per square inch (psi). The higher the schedule number, the thicker the pipe is. The outside diameter of each pipe size is standardized. Therefore, a particular nominal pipe size will have a different inside diameter depending upon the schedule number specified. Note that the original pipe wall thickness designations of STD, XS, and XXS have been retained; however, they correspond to a certain schedule number de- pending upon the nominal pipe size. The nominal wall thickness of NPS 10 and smaller schedule 40 pipe is same as that of STD. WT. pipe. Also, NPS 8 and smaller schedule 80 pipe has the same wall thickness as XS pipe. The schedule numbers followed by the letter S are per ASME B36.19M, and they are primarily intended for use with stainless steel pipe. The pipe wall thickness specified by a schedule number followed by the letter S may or may not be the same as that specified by a schedule number without the letter S. Refer to ASME B36.19M and ASME B36.10M.10,11 ASME B36.19M does not cover all pipe sizes. Therefore, the dimensional require- ments of ASME B36.10M apply to stainless steel pipe of the sizes and schedules not covered by ASME B36.19M. PIPING CLASSIFICATION It is usual industry practice to classify the pipe in accordance with the pressure- temperature rating system used for classifying flanges. However, it is not essential

A.6 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS TABLE A1.2 Piping Class Ratings Based on ASME B16.5 and Corresponding PN Designators Class 150 300 400 600 900 1500 2500 PN 20 50 68 110 150 260 420 Notes: 1. Pressure-temperature ratings of different classes vary with the temperature and the material of con- struction. 2 For pressure-temperature ratings, refer to tables in ASME B16.5, or ASME B16.34. that piping be classified as Class 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500. The piping rating must be governed by the pressure-temperature rating of the weakest pressure- containing item in the piping. The weakest item in a piping system may be a fitting made of weaker material or rated lower due to design and other considerations. Table A1.2 lists the standard pipe class ratings based on ASME B16.5 along with corresponding pression nominal (PN) rating designators. Pression nominal is the French equivalent of pressure nominal. In addition, the piping may be classified by class ratings covered by other ASME standards, such as ASME B16.1, B16.3, B16.24, and B16.42. A piping system may be rated for a unique set of pressures and temperatures not covered by any standard. Pression nominal (PN) is the rating designator followed by a designation number, which indicates the approximate pressure rating in bars. The bar is the unit of pressure, and 1 bar is equal to 14.5 psi or 100 kilopascals (kPa). Table A1.2 provides a cross-reference of the ASME class ratings to PN rating designators. It is evident that the PN ratings do not provide a proportional relationship between different PN numbers, whereas the class numbers do. Therefore, it is recommended that class numbers be used to designate the ratings. Refer to Chap. B2 for a more detailed discussion of class rating of piping systems. OTHER PIPE RATINGS Manufacturer’s Rating Based upon a unique or proprietary design of a pipe, fitting, or joint, the manufac- turer may assign a pressure-temperature rating that may form the design basis for the piping system. Examples include Victaulic couplings and the Pressfit system discussed in Chap. A9. In no case shall the manufacturer’s rating be exceeded. In addition, the manufac- turer may impose limitations which must be adhered to. NFPA Ratings The piping systems within the jurisdiction of the National Fire Protection Associa- tion (NFPA) requirements are required to be designed and tested to certain required pressures. These systems are usually rated for 175 psi (1207.5 kPa), 200 psi (1380 kPa), or as specified.

INTRODUCTION TO PIPING A.7 AWWA Ratings The American Water Works Association (AWWA) publishes standards and speci- fications, which are used to design and install water pipelines and distribution system piping. The ratings used may be in accordance with the flange ratings of AWWA C207, Steel Pipe Flanges; or the rating could be based upon the rating of the joints used in the piping. Specific or Unique Rating When the design pressure and temperature conditions of a piping system do not fall within the pressure-temperature ratings of above-described rating systems, the designer may assign a specific rating to the piping system. Examples of such applica- tions include main steam or hot reheat piping of a power plant, whose design pressure and design temperature may exceed the pressure-temperature rating of ASME B16.5 Class 2500 flanges. It is normal to assign a specific rating to the piping. This rating must be equal to or higher than the design conditions. The rating of all pressure-containing components in the piping system must meet or exceed the specific rating assigned by the designer. Dual Ratings Sometimes a piping system may be subjected to full-vacuum conditions or sub- merged in water and thus experience external pressure, in addition to withstanding the internal pressure of the flow medium. Such piping systems must be rated for both internal and external pressures at the given temperatures. In addition, a piping system may handle more than one flow medium during its different modes of operation. Therefore, such a piping system may be assigned a dual rating for two different flow media. For example, a piping system may have condensate flowing through it at some lower temperature during one mode of operation while steam may flow through it at some higher temperature during another mode of operation. It may be assigned two pressure ratings at two different temperatures. GENERAL DEFINITIONS Absolute Viscosity. Absolute viscosity or the coefficient of absolute viscosity is a measure of the internal resistance. In the centimeter, gram, second (cgs) or metric system, the unit of absolute viscosity is the poise (abbreviated P), which is equal to 100 centipoise (cP). The English units used to measure or express viscosity are slugs per foot-second or pound force seconds per square foot. Sometimes, the English units are also expressed as pound mass per foot-second or poundal seconds per square foot. Refer to Chap. B8 of this handbook. Adhesive Joint. A joint made in plastic piping by the use of an adhesive substance which forms a continuous bond between the mating surfaces without dissolving either one of them. Refer to Part D of this handbook.

INTRODUCTION TO PIPING A.19 Laminar Flow. Fluid flow in a pipe is usually considered laminar if the Reynolds number is less than 2000.

Liquid Penetrant Examination or Inspection. This is a nondestructive examina- tion method for finding discontinuities that are open to the surface of solid and essentially nonporous materials. This method is based on capillary action or capillary attraction by which the surface of a liquid in contact with a solid is elevated or depressed. A liquid penetrant, usually a red dye, is applied to the clean surface of the specimen. Time is allowed for the penetrant to seep into the opening. The excess penetrant is removed from the surface. A developer, normally white, is applied to aid in drawing the penetrant up or out to the surface.

It is character- ized by the presence of about 3 percent of slag irregularly mixed with pure iron and about 0.5 percent carbon and other elements in solution. Wrought Pipe. The term wrought pipe refers to both wrought steel and wrought iron. Wrought in this sense means ‘‘worked,’’ as in the process of forming furnace- welded pipe from skelp or seamless pipe from plates or billets. The expression wrought pipe is thus used as a distinction from cast pipe. Wrought pipe in this sense should not be confused with wrought-iron pipe, which is only one variety of wrought pipe. When wrought-iron pipe is referred to, it should be designated by its com- plete name. FORCES, MOMENTS, AND EQUILIBRIUM Simple Forces. When two or more forces act upon a body at one point, they may be single or combined into a resultant force. Conversely, any force may be resolved

A.32 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A1.24 Vectors and moments. into component forces. In Fig. A1.24, let the vectors F1 and F2 represent two forces acting on a point O. The resultant force F is represented in direction and magnitude by the diagonal of the parallelogram of which F1 and F2 are the sides. Conversely, any force F may be resolved into component forces by a reverse of the above operation. Moments. The moment of a force with respect to a given point is the tendency of that force to produce rotation around it. The magnitude of the moment is represented by the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from its line of action to the point or center of moment. In the English system of weights and measures, moments are expressed as the product of the force in pounds and the length of the moment arm in feet or inches, the unit of the moment being termed the pound-foot or the pound-inch. Moments acting in a clockwise direction are designated as positive, and those acting in a counterclockwise direction are negative. They may be added and subtracted algebraically, as moments, regardless of the direction of the forces themselves. With respect to Fig. A1.24, moments about an arbitrary point x are calculated as follows: Extend the line of action of F1 until its extension intersects the perpendicu- lar ax drawn from point x. Draw bx from x perpendicular to F2. The sum of moments about point x due to the two forces is then Alternatively, since F1 and F2 have been shown to be the vector equivalent of the resultant F, the moments about x can be calculated as Couples. Two parallel forces of equal magnitude acting in opposite directions constitute a couple. The moment of the couple is the product of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between the two. A couple has no single resultant and can be balanced only by another couple of equal moment of opposite sign. Law of Equilibrium. When a body is at rest, the external forces acting upon it must be in equilibrium and there must be a zero net moment on the body. This means that (1) the algebraic sums of the components of all forces with reference to any three axes of reference at right angles with one another must each be zero and (2) the algebraic sum of all moments with reference to any three such axes must be zero. When the forces all lie in the same plane, the algebraic sums of their components with respect to any two axes must be equal to zero and the algebraic sum of all moments with respect to any point in the plane must be zero.

INTRODUCTION TO PIPING A.33 WORK, POWER, AND ENERGY Work. When a body is moved against a resistance, work must be done upon the body. The amount of work done is the product of the force and the distance through which it acts.

The following symbols are used in this section in defining the interrelation of work, power, and energy: A �area, in2 or ft2 (mm2 or m2) as noted F �force, lbf (newton, N) g �local acceleration of gravity, ft/s2 (9 · 81 m/s2) gc �conversion constant, ft · lbf/(lbm · s2) [m · kgf/(kgm · s2)] h �vertical distance, ft (m) H �enthalpy, Btu (gram · cal) hp �horsepower (J/s, kW) kW �kilowatts KE �kinetic energy, ft · lbf (m · kgf) PE �potential energy, ft · lbf (m · kgf) p �pressure, psi (kPa, kg/cm2) l �distance, ft (m) T �time, s v �velocity, ft/s (m/s) V �volume, ft3 (m3) w �weight, lb (kg) W �work, ft · lb (m · kg) According to the above definition of work, the following expressions may be written to represent work: If the force is independent of distance, if the process takes place at sea level, if pressure and area are independent of distance, and if pressure is independent of volume, respectively, the above expressions reduce to where the subscripts 2 and 1 refer to final and initial states, respectively. The above expressions contain no term involving time, since the measure of work is independent of the time interval during which it is performed. Power. Power is the time rate of performing work. The English unit of power is the horsepower, which is defined at 33,000 ft · lb/min or 550 ft · lb/s. Electric power is commonly expressed in watts or kilowatts, 1 kW being equivalent to 1.34 hp and

A.34 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS 1 hp to 0.746 kW. The expressions for horsepower corresponding to those given above for work are Electric power is the product of volts and amperes, i.e., The above expression for the determination of electric power is strictly true for direct current and for alternating current with a zero power factor. For the latter case, if the power factor is different from zero, the expression becomes Energy. Energy is the capacity for doing work possessed by a system through virtue of work having previously been done upon it. Whenever work has been done upon a system in producing a change in its motion, its position, or its molecular condition, the system has acquired the capacity for doing work. Energy may be that due to motion, termed kinetic energy; that due to position, termed potential energy; or that due to molecular activity or configuration and is manifest as a change in its internal or stored energy. These three forms of energy are mutually convertible. In the English system, the units of energy are the foot-pound and the Btu, which are related by the fact that 1 Btu is equivalent to 778 ft · lb. Some of the more common expressions for energy are as follows: 1. The potential energy of a body of weight w lb mass which has been raised h ft against gravity is PE �(wg/gc)h. 2. The kinetic energy possessed by a body of weight w lb mass moving at a velocity v ft/s is KE �wv2/(2gc). 3. If the body of 1, initially at rest, were to fall freely through the distance h, its potential energy would be converted to kinetic energy and it would acquire a velocity v determined as follows: 4. The energy, resulting from its temperature, of a gas in motion is measured by its specific enthalpy h with units of Btu per pound mass. This energy is available for conversion to kinetic energy, as given by If the initial velocity v1 is negligible, there is obtained

INTRODUCTION TO PIPING A.35 5. Energy is measured in the English system in horsepower-hours, kilowatthours, Btu, and foot-pounds. The relations among these units are as follows: HEAT AND TEMPERATURE Units of Heat. The unit of heat commonly used in the English system is the British thermal unit, or Btu, and is approximately equal to the quantity of heat that must be transferred to one pound of water in order that its temperature be raised one degree Fahrenheit. In laboratory work and throughout much of the world, the calorie is the common unit of heat. A gram calorie is the approximate quantity of heat that must be transferred to 1 gram (g) of water in order to raise its temperature by 1�C. The kilocalorie, sometimes called the kilogram calorie, is equal to 1000 gram calories. The definitions above are indicated as being approximate because, over the temperature range from freezing to boiling points of water, different quantities of heat are required to produce a unit temperature change. For this reason, the calorie and the Btu have been defined in international units as In most engineering work, it is sufficiently accurate to use 1 kg · cal �3.968 Btu and 1 Btu �0.252 kg · cal. Units of Temperature. The relative ‘‘hotness’’ or ‘‘coldness’’ of a body is denoted by the term temperature. The temperature of a substance is measured by noting its effect upon a thermometer or pyrometer whose thermal properties are known. The mercury thermometer is suitable for measuring temperatures from �39 to about 600�F. This limit may be extended to 1000�F if the capillary tube above the mercury is filled with nitrogen or carbon dioxide under pressure. High temperatures must be measured with thermocouples or optical pyrometers. The most commonly used thermometer scales are the Fahrenheit and the Celsius. Thermometer scales have as their bases the melting and boiling points of water, both measured at atmospheric pressure. The relation of the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales is as follows: Freezing point Boiling point Absolute zero of water of water Degrees Fahrenheit �459.6 32 212 Degrees Celsius �273 0 100 The relation between the two scales is in which C is the reading on the Celsius scale and F is the reading on the Fahren- heit scale.

A.36 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS In certain calculations, it is necessary to express the temperature in ‘‘absolute’’ units. The absolute temperature associated with the Fahrenheit scale is called the Rankine temperature, and that associated with the Celsius scale is termed the Kelvin temperature. The relationships among these scales are as follows: where R and K designate absolute temperatures on the Rankine and Kelvin scales, respectively. Specific Heat. The specific heat of a substance is the quantity of heat required to produce a unit temperature change in a unit mass of that substance. Typical units are calories per gram per degree Celsius and Btu per pound per degree Fahrenheit. The numerical value of specific heat is a function of the process by which the unit temperature change is effected. If a gas expands at constant pressure owing to the addition of heat, work is done by the walls of the containing vessel on the surrounding atmosphere, and the heat addition must be greater than would have been required to cause the same temperature change at constant volume. The two most frequently used specific heats are those at constant volume and constant pressure, and they are represented symbolically as cv and cp, respectively. The definition of specific heat given in the preceding paragraph is convenient for engineering applications. By thermodynamic analysis, it can be shown that the two specific heats referred to are given by where u and h represent internal energy and enthalpy, respectively, and v and p indicate that volume or pressure remains constant during the measurement of the corresponding specific heat. The specific heats of most substances vary with temperature. For a general functional relationship, the mean value of specific heat over a temperature range from T1 to T2 is given by If the algebraic relationship between specific heat and temperature is not known but the relation is available in the form of a graph or table, it is usually sufficiently accurate to evaluate the average or mean specific heat at the average of temperature over the temperature range in question.

Engineering Supervisor Bechtel Power Corporation, Frederick, Maryland The term piping refers to the overall network of pipes, fittings, flanges, valves, and other components that comprise a conduit system used to convey fluids. Whether a piping system is used to simply convey fluids from one point to another or to process and condition the fluid, piping components serve an important role in the composition and operation of the system. A system used solely to convey fluids may consist of relatively few components, such as valves and fittings, whereas a complex chemical processing system may consist of a variety of components used to measure, control, condition, and convey the fluids. In the following sections, the characteristics and functions of the various piping components are described. PIPE AND TUBE PRODUCTS Pressure pipe and tube products are manufactured to a variety of standard specifica- tions of varying designs, employing different manufacturing practices and using a wide variety of materials. The end user of these products must apply the least- cost product suitable for the specified service conditions. Typically, steel and alloy pressure piping is available in cast, wrought, and seam-welded forms. Welded and seamless wrought steel pipe is supplied in standard sizes and wall thickness conform- ing to ASME B36.10M. Stainless-steel pipe is supplied in standard sizes and wall thickness conforming to ASME B36.19M. These standard pipe dimensions are tab- ulated in Apps. E2 and E2M, and the metric size equivalent DN of the NPS is given in Chap. A1. Some commonly specified piping materials are listed in Table A2.1. Pressure Tubing Pressure-tube applications commonly involve external heat applications, as in boil- ers or superheaters. Pressure tubing is produced to the actual outside diameter and minimum or average wall thickness specified by the purchaser. Pressure tubing may be hot- or cold-finished. The wall thickness is normally given in decimal parts of an inch rather than as a fraction or gauge number. When gauge numbers are given A.53

Weights of commercial tubing are given in Apps. E3 and E3M. Pressure tubing is usually made from steel produced by the open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric furnace processes. Seamless pressure tubing may be either hot- finished or cold-drawn. Cold-drawn steel tubing is frequently process-annealed at temperatures above 1200�F (650�C). To ensure quality, maximum hardness values are frequently specified. Hot-finished or cold-drawn seamless low-alloy steel tubes generally are process-annealed at temperatures between 1200�F (650�C) and 1350�F (730�C). Austenitic stainless-steel tubes are usually annealed at temperatures be- tween 1800�F (980�C) and 2100�F (1150�C), with specific temperatures varying somewhat with each grade. This is generally followed by pickling, unless bright annealing was done. Pipe Fittings The major piping materials are also produced in the form of standard fittings. Among the more widely used materials are ductile or cast iron, malleable iron, brass, copper, cast steel, forged steel, and wrought steel. Other major nonferrous piping materials are also produced in the form of cast and wrought fittings. Ductile and cast-iron fittings are made by conventional foundry methods for a variety of joints including bell-and-spigot, push-on flanged, and mechanical (gland-type) or other proprietary designs. Ductile and Cast-Iron Fittings Cast-iron fittings are covered by a number of ASME and ANSI/AWWA standards: ASME B16.1 Cast Iron Pipe Flanges and Flanged Fittings, Class 25, 125, 250, and 800 (The standard also includes bolt, nut, and gasket data.)

Malleable-Iron Threaded Fittings Malleable-iron fittings are also extensively produced. They are generally made with threaded joints. Malleable-iron threaded fittings for Classes 150 and 300 are standardized in ASME B16.3. The standard specifies the same attributes for Class 150 and 300 fittings as discussed under ASME B16.4 for gray-iron fittings. The fittings are available in a variety of configurations from NPS ¹⁄₈ (DN 3) through NPS 6 (DN 150). The pressure-temperature ratings of these fittings are listed in Table A2.3. As with cast-iron fittings, the ratings are independent of the contained fluid and are maximum nonshock pressures at the listed temperatures. Malleable- iron fittings are furnished black, galvanized, or as otherwise ordered by the buyer. The galvanized threaded fittings commonly used in water piping for homes are Class 150 malleable iron. Minimum properties of malleable iron are required to meet ASTM A197 Cupola Malleable Iron requirements. The fittings are threaded with ASME B1.20.1 pipe threads. Cast-Brass and Cast-Bronze Threaded Fittings Cast-brass and -bronze threaded fittings are commonly produced for use with brass pipe. The fittings are manufactured in accordance with ASME B16.15 in pressure Classes 125 and 250. The standard establishes pressure-temperature ratings, size and method of designating openings of reducing fittings, marking, minimum require- ments for casting quality, and materials. The nonshock pressure-temperature ratings are listed in Table A2.4. The permitted materials for the fittings are: ASTM B62, alloy C83600 ASTM B584, alloy C83800 and C84400 ASTM B16, alloy C36000 (bar stock)* ASTM B140, alloy C32000 or C31400 (bar stock)* * Used for manufacture of threaded plugs, bushings, and caps.

Soldered-Joint Fittings Soldered-joint wrought metal and cast-brass or -bronze fittings for use with copper water tubes are covered by ASTM B88 and H23.1. The fittings are made in accor- dance with ASME B16.22 and B16.18, respectively. Joints using these types of fittings and made with 50–50 tin-lead solder, 95-tin 5-antimony solder, or solder melting above 1100�F (593�C) have the pressure-temperature ratings shown in Table A2.5. (Note: Lead-bearing solder is not permitted for potable water service.) Wrought copper fittings normally have a minimum copper content of 83 percent. Cast-brass fittings conform to ASTM B62 and have a nominal composition of 85 percent copper, 5 percent tin, 5 percent lead, and 5 percent zinc. The minimum requirements for 50–50 tin-lead solder generally used with these fittings are covered in ASTM B32 alloy grade 50A.

A.58 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Cast-Iron Flanged Fittings Cast-iron flanged fittings are produced in accordance with ASME B16.1. The stan- dard specifies pressure-temperature ratings, sizes, marking, minimum requirements for materials, dimensions and tolerances, bolting, gasketing, and testing require- ments. The fittings are manufactured in a variety of configurations (tees, elbows, crosses, laterals, etc.) in pressure Classes 25, 125, 250, and 800. Not all sizes and styles are available in all ratings. The sizes available in each class are listed below: Pressure class Size range, NPS (DN) 25 4 (100) through 72 (1800) 125 1 (25) through 96 (2400) 250 1 (25) through 30 (750) 800 2 (50) through 12 (300) The nonshock pressure-temperature ratings for the four pressure classes are listed in Table A2.6. The materials of construction are ASTM A 126 class A or B, as shown in Table A2.6. Cast- and Forged-Steel and Nickel-Alloy Flanged Fittings Flanged fittings of steel and nickel alloys are manufactured in accordance with ASME B16.5. The standard covers ratings, materials, dimensions, tolerances, mark- ing, testing, and methods of designating openings for pipe flanges and flanged fittings in sizes NPS ¹⁄₂ (DN 15) through NPS 24 (DN 600) and in rating Classes 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500. However, not all sizes are available in all pressure classes. Dimensions of more commonly used fittings are given in Table A2.7. The standard also contains recommendations and requirements for bolting and gaskets. Within each pressure class, the dimensions of the fittings are held constant, irrespective of the materials being used. Since the physical properties of different materials vary, the pressure-temperature ratings within each pressure class vary with the material. As an example, a Class 600 forged carbon steel (A105) flange is rated at 1270 psig at 400�F, whereas a Class 600 forged stainless steel (A182, F304) flange is rated at 940 psig at 400�F. The matrix of materials and pressure classes is too numerous to reproduce here; therefore, the reader is referred to ASME B16.5 for the flanged fitting pressure-temperature ratings. Figures A2.1, A2.2, and A2.3 illustrate the reduction in pressure rating with increase in temperature for group 1.1 (ASTM A105), 1.10 (ASTM A182, Gr. F22, Cl. 3), and 2.1 (ASTM A182, Gr. F304) materials. Forged-Steel Threaded and Socket-Welding Fittings Forged-steel socket welding and threaded fittings are manufactured in accordance with ASME B16.11. The standard covers pressure-temperature ratings, dimensions, tolerances, marking, and material requirements for forged carbon and alloy steel fittings in the styles and sizes listed in Tables A2.8 and A2.9. Acceptable material forms are forgings, bars, seamless pipe, and seamless tubes which conform to the

PIPING COMPONENTS A.65 FIGURE A2.3 Operating temperature versus allowable working pressure for ASME B16.5 flanges and flanged fittings—Group 2.1 materials. (From ASME B16.5, 1996) chemical compositions, melting practices, and mechanical property requirements of ASTM A105, A182, or A350. Threaded fittings are available in pressure Classes 2000, 3000, and 6000. Socket- welded fittings are available in pressure Classes 3000, 6000, and 9000. Limitations on fitting size and service conditions are as provided for by the code governing the installation. The maximum allowable pressure of the fitting is equal to that computed for straight seamless pipe of equivalent material, considering manufacturing toler- ance, corrosion allowance, and mechanical strength allowance. Also, for socket- welding fittings, the pressure rating must be matched to the pipe wall thickness to ensure that the flat of the band can accommodate the size of the fillet weld required by the applicable code. The recommended fitting pressure class for the various pipe wall thicknesses is as follows: Threaded Socket-welded Pipe schedule and designation class class 80/XS or less 2000 3000 160 3000 6000 XXS 6000 9000 Internal threads of threaded fittings are in accordance with ASME B1.20.1-Pipe Threads, General Purpose (Inch).

Wrought-Steel Butt-Welding Fittings Wrought-steel welding fittings include elbows, tees, crosses, reducers, laterals, lap- joint stub ends, caps, and saddles. Wrought-steel fittings are made to the dimensional requirements of ASME B16.9 in sizes NPS ¹⁄₂ (DN 15) through NPS 48 (DN 1200). Also, short-radius elbows and returns are produced in accordance with ASME B16.28 in sizes NPS ¹⁄₂ (DN 15) through NPS 24 (DN 600). The wrought fitting materials conform to ASTM A234, A403, or A420, the grades of which have chemical and physical properties equivalent to that of the mating pipe. ASME B16.9 requires that the pressure-temperature rating of the fitting equal or exceed that of the mating pipe of the same or equivalent material, same size, and same nominal wall thickness. The pressure-temperature rating may be established by analysis or by proof testing. Short-radius elbows and returns (fitting centerline bend radius is equal to the fitting NPS) manufactured under ASME B16.28 are rated at 80 percent of the rating calculated for seamless straight pipe of the same size and nominal thickness and same or equivalent material. Therefore, both standards require that, in lieu of specifying any pressure rating, the pipe wall thickness and pipe material type with which the fittings are intended to be used be identified on the fitting. Pressure testing of the fittings is not required by either standard. However, the fittings are required to be capable of withstanding, without leakage, a test pressure equal to that prescribed in the specification of the pipe with which the fitting is recommended to be used. Both ASME B16.9 and B16.28 prescribe dimensions and manufacturing toler- ances of wrought butt-welded fittings. The standards establish laying dimensions,

Tables A2.11, A2.12, A2.13, A2.14, and A2.15 list the laying dimensions and approximate weights for selected fitting sizes, pipe schedules, and con- figurations. Laterals are not governed by any national standard. However, dimensions of laterals commonly used are given in Table A2.16. Working pressures are rated at 40 percent of the allowable working pressure established for pipe from which laterals are made. Where full allowable pipe pressures must be met, the laterals are generally made from heavier pipe with ends machined to match standard pipe dimensions.

Forged Branch Fittings Under the various pressure piping codes, branch connections may be made by welding the branch pipe or a welding outlet fitting to the run pipe, provided sufficient reinforcement is available to compensate for the material removed from the run pipe to create the branch opening. The reinforcement may be in the form of excess material already available in the run and branch pipes, or it may be added. At the writing of this book, national standards governing the dimensions, tolerances, and manufacture of welding outlet fittings had not been issued. However, MSS-SP-97, 1995, has been developed to cover forged-carbon-steel 90�branch outlet fittings in butt-welding, socket-welding, and threaded outlet ends. The standard provides essential dimensions, finish, tolerances, and testing requirements. Because of the absence of strict standards, manufacturers produce welding outlet fittings of their own proprietary designs. These fittings must comply with the codes governing the systems in which the fittings are to be installed. The fittings, when installed in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations, include the required rein- forcement. The dimensions of these fittings vary; standardized dimensions and properties must be obtained from the manufacturers. Also, designers must consider the appropriate parameters (e.g., stress intensification factors). Figure A2.4 shows several types of welding fittings, which are proprietary; the terminology used varies with the manufacturer. The fittings are produced in carbon and alloy steels under the ASTM specifications for forgings permitted by applica- ble codes.

Some principal types of steam traps are: ●Float ●Thermostatic ●Thermodynamic ●Inverted bucket

*Source: piping-handbook*

PIPING COMPONENTS A.81 The float type (Fig. A2.5) consists of a chamber containing a float-and-arm mechanism which modulates the posi- tion of a discharge valve. As the level of condensate in the trap rises, the valve is opened to emit the condensate. This type of valve tends to discharge a steady stream of liquid since the valve position is proportional to the rate of incoming condensate. Because the discharge valve FIGURE A2.5 Float steam trap. (Spirax is below the waterline, float-type steam Sarco Inc.) traps must employ a venting system to discharge noncondensable gases. This is generally accomplished with a thermo- static element which opens a valve when cooler noncondensable gases are pres- ent but closes the valve in the presence of hotter steam. The thermostatic steam trap (Fig. A2.6) contains a thermostatic element which opens and closes a valve in response to fluid temperature. Con- densate collected upstream of the valve is subcooled, cooling the thermostat, which, in turn, exposes the discharge port. When the cooler condensate is dis- charged and the incoming condensate temperature approaches the saturation temperature, the thermostat closes the discharge port. Because of its principle of operations, the thermostatic trap op- erates intermittently under all but maxi- mum condensate loads. The inverted bucket steam trap (Fig. A2.7) consists of a chamber containing an inverted bucket (the opening at the bottom) which actuates a discharge valve through a linkage. The valve is open when the bucket rests at the bot- tom of the trap. This allows air to escape during warm-up until the bottom of the bucket is sealed by rising condensate. The valve remains open as long as con- densate is flowing, and trapped air bleeds out through a small vent in the top of the bucket. When steam enters the trap, it fills the bucket, causing the bucket to float so it rises and closes the valve. The steam slowly escapes through the bucket vent and condenses, thus allowing the bucket to sink and reopen FIGURE A2.6 Thermostatic steam trap. (a) the valve for condensate flow.

A.82 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A2.7 Inverted bucket steam trap. FIGURE A2.8 Thermodynamic steam trap (Spirax Sarco Inc.) (with integral strainer). (Spirax Sarco Inc.) gases (such as carbon dioxide) that enter the trap during normal operation are also vented through the small opening in the top of the bucket, which prevents the trap from becoming air-bound. The thermodynamic steam trap is illustrated in Fig. A2.8. In this type of trap, flashing of the hot condensate tends to force a small piston into the discharge opening when the temperature of the condensate approaches within about 30�F (15�C) of the saturation temperature. As soon as the condensate collected in the drain system cools sufficiently below the flash temperature, the trap opens and discharges the accumulated water until the temperature of the condensate once more approaches the saturation temperature and flashes, thereby closing the trap and again repeating the cycle. A small orifice permits a continuous discharge of steam, flashed vapor, or noncondensable gas when the trap is closed. Single orifices are sometimes used to remove condensate from high-pressure, high-temperature steam lines. Where the drains are required only in bringing the line up to temperature, the use of orifices, in conjunction with valves, is particu- larly desirable. Air (drain) traps are used to discharge condensed liquid—from a gas system. The drain trap operates on the same principle as the float steam trap does, except that the drain trap does not contain a thermostatic clement. STRAINERS Strainers are used in piping systems to protect equipment sensitive to dirt and other particles that may be carried by the fluid. During system start-up and flushing, strainers may be placed upstream of pumps to protect them from construction debris that may have been left in the pipe. Figure A2.9 depicts a typical start-up

PIPING COMPONENTS A.83 strainer. Permanent strainers may be in- stalled upstream of control valves, traps, and instrutments to protect them from corrosion products that may become dis- lodged and carried throughout the pip- ing system. Strainers are available in a variety of styles, including wye and basket. The wye strainer (Fig. A2.10) is gen- erally used upstream of traps, control valves, and instruments. The wye strainer resembles a lateral branch fitting FIGURE A2.9 Conical start-up strainer. with the strainer element installed in the branch. The end of the lateral branch is removable, to permit servicing of the strainer. Also, a blow-off connection may be provided in the end cap to flush the strainer. FIGURE A2.10 Wye strainer.

A.84 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Basket strainers (Fig. A2.11) are generally used where high flow capacity is required. The basket strainer is serviced by removing the cover, which yields access to the basket. Basket strainers are also available in a duplex style which consists of two parallel basket strainers and diverting valves, which permit diversion of the flow through one of the strainer elements while the other element is being serviced—an essential feature where flow cannot be interrupted. EXPANSION JOINTS Expansion joints are used in piping systems to absorb thermal expansion where the use of expansion loops is undesirable or impractical. Expansion joints are available in slip, ball, metal bellows, and rubber bellows configurations. Slip-type expansion joints (Fig. A2.12a) have a sleeve that telescopes into the body. Leakage is controlled by packing located between the sleeve and the body. Leakage is minimal and can be near zero in many applications. A completely leak- free seal cannot be ensured; thus these expansion joints are ruled out where zero leakage is required. The packing is subject to wear due to cyclic movement of the sleeve when connected piping expands and contracts. Thus, these joints require periodic maintenance, either to compress the packing by tightening a packing gland or to replace or replenish the packing. Replacement of the packing rings is necessary when leakage develops in a joint that has an adjustable packing gland which has been tightened to its limit. Some designs provide for packing replenishment rather than replacement. These are usually called gun-packed or ram-packed slip joints. Since the packing can wear away, some packing material may be picked up in the line fluid. This rules out the use of slip joints in systems, where such contamination of fluid cannot be tolerated. Slip-type expansion joints are particularly suited for lines having straight-line (axial) movements of large magnitude. Slip joints cannot tolerate lateral offset or angular rotation (cocking) since this would cause binding, galling, and possibly leakage due to packing distortion. Therefore, the use of proper pipe alignment guides is essential. Ball expansion joints (Fig. A2.12b) consist of a socket and ball with a sealing mechanism placed between them. The seals are of rigid materials, and in some designs a pliable sealant may be injected into the cavity located between the ball and socket. The joints are capable of absorbing angular and axial rotation; however, they cannot accommodate movement along the longitudinal axis of the joint. There- fore, an offset must be installed in the line to absorb pipe axial movement. Bellows-type expansion joints (Fig. A2.13) do not have packing; thus they do not have the potential leakage or fluid contamination problems sometimes associ- ated with slip joints. Likewise, they do not require the periodic maintenance (lubrica- tion and repacking) that is associated with slip joints. Bellows joints absorb expan- sion and contraction by means of a flexible bellows that is compressed or extended. They can also accommodate direction changes by various combinations of compres- sion on one side and extension on an opposing side. Thus, they can adjust to lateral offset and angular rotation of the connected piping. However, they are not capable of absorbing torsional movement. Typically, the bellows is corrugated metal and is welded to the end pieces. To provide the requisite flexibility, the metal bellows is considerably thinner than the associated piping. Thus these expansion joints are especially susceptible to rupture by overpressure. A bellows can also fail because of metal fatigue if the accumulated flexing cycles exceed the designed fatigue life

(cyclic life) of the bellows or if the flexing extremes exceed the designed compression and extension limits. Rubber expansion joints (Fig. A2.14) are similar in design to metal bellows expansion joints except that they are constructed of fabric and wire-reinforced elastomers. They are most suitable for use in cold water service where large move- ments must be absorbed (e.g., condenser circulating water). THREADED JOINTS Threaded joints are normally used in low-pressure small-bore, nonflammable ser- vice, although threaded iron pipe is commonly used in domestic gas piping and threaded joints up to NPS 12 (DN 300) have been used in low-pressure liquid service. For quality joints, it is essential to have smooth, clean threads. A proper form for a pipe threading die is shown in Fig. A6.27. Because cut-thread surfaces are somewhat imperfect, thread sealants (pipe dope) and lubricants are often used to ensure a leak-tight joint. Lubricants such as linseed oil or a compound containing powdered zinc or nickel are sufficient to produce a leak-tight joint in well-made threads. Imperfect threads may require white lead or plumber’s tape to provide a good seal. In high-pressure piping where leakage cannot be tolerated, the threaded joints may be seal-welded. Where seal welding is employed, all exposed threads should be covered to prevent cracking in the weld. Dimensional Standards. Dimensional standards for threads are established in ASME Standard B1.20.1. This standard specifies dimensions, tolerances, and gaug- ing for tape and straight pipe threads, including certain special applications. The normal type of pipe joint employs a tapered external and tapered internal thread. But straight pipe threads are used to advantage for certain types of pipe couplings, grease cup, fuel and oil fittings, mechanical joints for fixtures, and conduit and hose couplings.

PIPING COMPONENTS A.87 Pressure-Tight Joints Pressure-tight joints for low-pressure service are sometimes made with straight internal threads and the American standard taper external threads. The ductility of the coupling enables the straight thread to conform to the taper of the pipe thread. In commercial practice, straight-tapped couplings are furnished for standard- weight (schedule 40) pipe NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller. If taper-tapped couplings are required for standard-weight pipe sizes NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller, line pipe in accordance with API 5L should be ordered. The thread lengths should be in accordance with the American Standard for Pipe Threads, ASME B1.20.1. Taper- tapped couplings are furnished on extra-strong (schedule 80) pipe in all sizes and on standard-weight NPS 2¹⁄₂ (DN 65) and larger. Dry-seal pipe threads machined in accordance with ASME B1.20.3 are also employed for pressure-tight joints, particularly where the presence of a lubricant or sealer would contaminate the flow medium. Threads are similar to the pipe threads covered by ASME B1.20.1; the essential difference is that, in dry-seal pipe threads, the truncation of the crest and root is controlled to ensure metal-to-metal contact coincident with or prior to flank contact, thus eliminating spiral leakage paths. Dry-seal pipe threads are used in refrigerant systems and for fuel and hydrau- lic control lines in aircraft, automotive, and marine service. Thread sizes up to NPS 3 (DN 75) are covered by ASME B1.20.3. Hose Nipples and Couplings. Hose coupling joints are ordinarily used with a gasket and made with straight internal and external loose-fitting threads. There are several standards of hose threads having various diameters and pitches, one of which is based on the American standard pipe thread. With this thread series, it is possible to join small hose sizes ¹⁄₂ to 2 in, inclusive, to ends of standard pipe having American standard external taper pipe threads, by using a gasket to seal the joint. ASME B1.20.7 applies to the threaded parts of hose couplings, valves, nozzles, and all other fittings used in di- rect connection with hose intended for fire protection or for domestic and indus- trial general services. However, fire hose coupling dimensions and threads vary with fire districts, and the local fire au- thority must be consulted. Figure A2.15 illustrates a typical fire hose coupling. FIGURE A2.15 Typical fire hose coupling. Bolted Joints The use of bolted joints is advantageous in the following circumstances: ●The components cannot be serviced in line. ●The components being joined are not capable of being welded. ●Quick field assembly is required. ●The component or pipe section must be frequently removed for service. Bolted piping components are manufactured in accordance with several national standards. Also, several manufacturers produce proprietary bolted connections

The standard establishes dimensional requirements, pressure ratings, materials, and bolting requirements. The pressure-temperature ratings and materials requirements for cast-iron flanges are the same as those for cast-iron flanged fittings. The pressure-temperature ratings are given in Table A2.6. The dimensions for Class 125 and Class 250 cast-iron flanges are listed in Table A2.17. XDimensions for bolting are listed in Table A2.18. Note that the Class 125 and Class 250 flanges can be mated with ASME B16.5 Class 150 and Class 300 steel flanges, respectively. When a Class 150 flange is bolted to a Class 125 cast-iron flange (a flat-faced flange), the steel flange should be flat-faced.

ANSI/AWWA C110/A21.10, C115/A21.15 and C153/A21.53, are listed earlier under ductile and cast iron fittings. Steel and Nickel-Alloy Flanges. Steel and nickel-alloy flanges up to NPS 24 are produced in accordance with ASME B16.5. Steel flanges NPS 26 (DN 650) through NPS 60 (DN 1500) are produced in accordance with ASME B16.47. Also, orifice flanges are produced in accordance with ASME B16.36. The standards specify materials, dimensions, pressure-temperature ratings, and recommendations for bolt- ing and gasketing. Flanges manufactured to ASME B16.5 and B16.47 may be cast or forged. Also, blind flanges may be fabricated from specific plate materials. The most commonly used materials are forged carbon steel (ASTM A105) and forged low-alloy and stainless steel (ASTM A182). The standards cover seven pressure classes (Classes 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500) in a variety of styles and materials. Figures A2.16 and A2.17 show typical flange styles. The dimensions of each style within each pressure class are held constant irrespective of the material. Therefore, within each pressure class, the pressure-temperature rating varies with the material properties (see Figs. A2.1, A2.2, and A2.3).

Flange Types Flanges differ in method of attachment to the pipe, i.e., whether they are screwed, welded, or lapped. Contact surface facings may be plain, serrated, grooved for ring joints, seal-welded, or ground and lapped for metal-to-metal contact. Some common

PIPING COMPONENTS A.91 types of joints and facings are shown in Fig. A2.18. In Section VIII, Unfired Pressure Vessels, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, three types of circular flanges are defined, and these are designated as loose-type (Fig. A2.17), integral-type (Fig. A2.16), and optional-type flanges. Under the code, the welds and other details of construc- tion shall satisfy the dimensional re- quirements stated therein. FIGURE A2.16 Typical integral flange (weld- ing neck flange). Loose-Type Flanges. This (slip-on) type covers those designs in which the flange has no direct connection to the nozzle neck or the vessel or pipe wall and those designs where the method of attachment is not considered to give the mechanical strength equivalent of integral attachment. Integral-Type Flanges. This type covers designs in which the flange is cast or forged integrally with the nozzle neck or the vessel or pipe wall, butt-welded thereto, or attached by other forms of arc or gas welding of such a nature that the flange FIGURE A2.17 Typical loose flanges (threaded and slip-on). and nozzle neck or vessel or pipe wall is considered to be the equivalent of an integral structure. In welded construction, the nozzle neck or the vessel or pipe wall is considered to act as a hub. Optional-Type Flanges. This type covers designs where the attachment of the flange to the nozzle neck or the vessel or pipe wall is such that the assembly is considered to act as a unit, which shall be calculated as an integral flange, except that for simplicity the designer may calculate the construction as a loose-type flange, provided that stipulated load values are not exceeded. It is important in flange design to select materials and to proportion dimensions of bolts, flanges, and gaskets to ensure that the necessary compression will be maintained on the joint faces over the expected life of the equipment. Several distinct phases of the problem are involved: (1) type of flange facing, (2) finish of contact surfaces, (3) gasket type and proportions, (4) bolt load required to secure and maintain a tight joint, and (5) proportions of flange needed to support the bolt load. Types of Flange Facing. There are numerous types of contact facings for flanges, the simplest of which is the plain face provided with a ‘‘smooth tool finish.’’ Class 125 cast-iron flanged fittings are provided with this type of facing.

Where metal gaskets are used with these facings, the gasket area should be reduced to increase the gasket compression.

FIGURE A2.20 Typical facing dimensions for Sargol and Sarlun joints, Class 150 to 2500 flanges (see footnotes). male-and-female, and ring joint. Because of the small gasket contact area, a tight joint may be secured with the ring-type facing using low bolting loads, thereby resulting in lowered flange stresses (ASME B16.5). The Sargol and Sarlun facings, which have lips for seal welding, are used frequently for severe service conditions. Seal welding is not always performed since, if it is properly made, a tight joint often can be maintained without the welded seal, thus facilitating disassembly. Typical facing dimensions for Sarlun and Sargol joints are shown in Fig. A2.20. Special types of facing of individual design intended for a specific service are numerous. Economic considerations generally make it desirable to use a standard facing wher- ever possible. Selection of the type of facing depends to a considerable extent on the nature of the service. However, it is not possible to determine exactly which facing should be used. Prior experience is usually relied on as a guide. Plain-face joints with red rubber gaskets have been found satisfactory for temperatures up to 220�F (105�C), whereas serrated raised-face joints with graphite-steel-composition gaskets are com- monly used for temperatures up to 750�F (400�C). For high temperatures and pressures, faces giving a high contact pressure for a given bolt load are customary, such as the tongue-and-groove and ring joints. However, with high contact pressures, the gasket load must be checked to ensure that the gasket is not overcompressed.

*Source: piping-handbook*

PIPING COMPONENTS A.95 An equally successful joint for most types of service can be made by using a profile- serrated metal gasket contacting the flange facing, which may be the plain male- to-male raised-face type. Contact Surface Finish. The surface finish is an important factor in determining the extent to which a gasket must flow to secure an impervious seal. Bolting that results in adequate gasket flow to form a satisfactory seal with a smooth contact surface may be inadequate to secure a tight joint with a rough surface. The finish may vary from that produced by rough casting surfaces to that produced by grinding and lapping. Less gasket flow will be necessary for the latter than for the former. The finish most frequently provided on cast-iron and steel pipe flanges is the smooth tool finish. A serrated finish frequently is provided for steel flanges, particularly when using a graphite-composition gasket with a wide contact area such as is furnished on raised, lapped, or large tongue-and-groove facings. The serrated finish consists of spiral or concentric grooves, usually about 1/64 in (0.4 mm) deep with 12.5 serrations per cm (32 serrations per inch). Where metal gaskets are used, a smooth surface produced by grinding or lapping is usually provided. The Sargol and Sarlun facings mate metal to metal without a gasket, in which case a mirrorlike finish is necessary. This is usually produced by grinding and lapping. It is evident that the surface finish varies with the type of contact face and gasket used and, therefore, should be specified accordingly. Gaskets Since it is expensive to grind and lap joint faces to obtain fluid-tight joints, a gasket of some softer material is usually inserted between contact faces. Tightening the bolts causes the gasket material to flow into the minor machining imperfections, resulting in a fluid-tight seal. A considerable variety of gasket types are in common use. Soft gaskets, such as cork, rubber, vegetable fiber, graphite, or asbestos, are usually plain with a relatively smooth surface. The semimetallic design combines metal and a soft material, the metal to withstand the pressure, temperature, and attack of the confined fluid and the soft material to impart resilience. Various designs involving corrugations, strip-on-edge, metal jackets, etc., are available. In addition to the plain, solid, and flat-surface metal gaskets, various modified designs and cross-sectional shapes of the profile, corrugated, serrated, and other types are used. The object in general has been to retain the advantage of the metal gasket but to reduce the contact area to secure a seal without excessive bolting load. Effective gasket widths are given in various sections of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Gasket Materials. Gasket materials are selected for their chemical and pressure resistance to the fluid in the pipe and their resistance to deterioration by tempera- ture. Gasket materials may be either metallic or nonmetallic. Metallic ring-joint gasket materials are covered by ASME Standard B16.20, Ring-Joint Gaskets and Grooves for Steel Pipe Flanges. Nonmetallic gaskets are covered in ASME Standard B16.21, Nonmetallic Gaskets for Pipe Flanges. Typical selections of gasket materials for different services are shown in Table A2.19. Gasket Compression. In the usual type of high-pressure flange joint, a narrow gasket face or contact surface is provided to obtain higher unit compression on the gasket than is obtainable on full-face gaskets used with low-pressure joints.

PIPING COMPONENTS A.97 pressure is applied, depends on the bolt loading used. In the case of standard raised- face joints of the steel-flange standards, these gasket compressions range from 28 to 43 times the rated working pressure in the Class 150 to 400 standards, and from 1 to 28 times in the Class 600 to 2500 standards for an assumed bolt stress of 60,000 psi (4200 kg/cm2). For the lower-pressure standards, using composition gaskets, a bolt stress of 30,000 psi (2100 kg/cm2) usually is adequate. The effect of applying the internal pressure is to decrease the compression on the contact surface, since part of the bolt tension is used to support the pressure load. The initial compression required to force the gasket material into intimate contact with the joint faces depends upon the gasket material and the character of the joint facing. For soft-rubber gaskets, a unit compression stress of 4000 psi (280 kg/cm2) to 6000 psi (420 kg/cm2) usually is adequate. Laminated asbestos gaskets in serrated faced joints perform satisfactorily if compressed initially at 12,000 psi (850 kg/cm2) to 18,000 psi (1260 kg/cm2). Metal gaskets such as copper, Monel, and soft iron should be given initial compressions considerably in excess of their yield strengths. Unit pressures of 30,000 psi (2100 kg/cm2) to 60,000 psi (4200 kg/cm2) have been used successfully with metal gaskets. Various forms of corrugated and serrated metal gaskets are available which enable high unit compression to be obtained without excessive bolt loads. These are designed to provide a contact area that will flow under initial compression of the bolts so as to make an initially pressure-tight joint, but at the same time the compressive stresses in the body of the gasket are sufficiently low as to be comparable to the long-time load-carrying ability of the bolting and flange material at high temperatures. The residual compression on the gasket necessary to prevent leakage depends on how effective the initial compression has been in forming intimate contact with the flange joint faces. Tests show that a residual compression on the gasket of only 1 to 2 times the internal pressure, with the pressure acting, may be sufficient to prevent leakage where the joint is not subjected to bending or to large and rapid temperature changes. Since joints in piping customarily must withstand both these disturbing influences, minimum residual gasket compressions of 4 to 6 times the working pressure should be provided for in the design of pipe joints. Relation of Gaskets to Bolting. There is a tendency, as indicated in the ASME Rules for Bolted Flanged Connections, to assign lower residual contact-pressure ratios ranging from about 1 for soft-rubber gaskets to 6 or 7 for solid-metal gaskets. Whereas these are said to have proved satisfactory service for heat-exchanger and pressure-vessel flanges, the more severe service encountered by pipe flanges due to bending moments and large temperature changes is considered by many to warrant designing on the basis of the larger residual gasket compression ratios recommended in the previous paragraph. The lack of understanding of the mechan- ics of gasket action, the variety of gasket materials, shapes, widths, and thicknesses; the variety of facings used; the variation in flange stiffness; and the uncertainties in bolt pull-up are among the factors that render difficult a precise solution to the problem of gasket design. Rules for bolting and flange design are contained in Sections III and VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Bolting Bolting material for cast-iron flanges is listed in ASME B16.1. Generally, ASTM A307, grade B material is suitable. For steel flanges, acceptable bolting material is listed in ASME B16.5.

A.98 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Threading. Bolts and nuts normally are threaded in accordance with ASME B1.1 Standard for Unified Screw Threads. In diameters 1 in and smaller, Class 2A fits on the bolt or stud and Class 2B on the nut applies with the coarse thread series. In diameters 1¹⁄₈ in and larger, the eight-pitch-thread series applies with the same fit. Grade 7 bolts are threaded by roll threading after heat treatment. Roll threading cold-works the surface uniformly. The resulting compressive stresses provide sub- stantially increased fatigue strength at the thread root, which is usually the weakest point. The thread root is the weakest point because it is the smallest cross-sectional area in the bolt. The stressed area A of a bolt is computed from A = 0.7854(D −0.9743)2 N where D is the nominal bolt diameter and N represents the threads per inch. Bolts with fine threads will exhibit a slightly higher proof strength (about 10 percent) than bolts with coarse threads (as illustrated in Fig. A2.21), provided that the length of engagement with the mating internal thread is sufficient to guarantee a tensile failure through the bolt rather than failure by thread stripping. In practical bolt assemblies, fine threads are considered weaker because of reduced thread height. Fine threads have limited application for threaded as- FIGURE A2.21 Comparison of proof strength semblies.

Dimensions The dimensions applicable to bolting materials are given in ASME B16.5, American Standard Pipe Flanges and Flanged Fittings. Securing and Tightening. For the average low- and medium-pressure installations, bolts are made in staggered sequence with wrenches which will usually result in adequately tight joints. For the high-pressure and -temperature joints, it becomes increasingly important to make up each stud to a definite tension. Torque wrenches are sometimes used for this purpose. In exceptional cases where a more positive method is desired, the studs may be tightened until a definite elongation has been attained. For this condition, an initial cold tension of 30,000 psi (2100 kg/cm2) to 35,000 psi (2460 kg/cm2) in each stud is recommended. Since the modulus of elasticity of stud material is about 30 �106 psi (2.1 �106 kg/cm2), a tension of 30,000 psi (2100 kg/cm2) would result in an elongation 0.1% of effective length. The effective length is the distance between nut faces plus one nut thickness. Special studs with ground ends are required to make micrometer measurements for this purpose. After the joint has been in service, periodic checks of the actual cold lengths as compared with the tabulated lengths will detect any permanent elongation of the studs. Permanent elongation will indicate

When these conditions become severe, new studs may be required to maintain the joint properly. Special thread lubricants are available for temperatures both below 500�F (260�C) and from 500�F (260�C) to 1000�F (540�C). Such lubricants not only facilitate initial tightening but also permit easier disassembly after service. Table A2.20 illustrates the turning effort required for tightening well-lubricated threads and bearing surfaces. Tests with no lubricant on threads and bearing surfaces may increase torque requirements by 75 to 100 percent to secure a given bolt stress. For more information on bolted joints, see Chap. A7.

A.100 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS and flanged joints. Furthermore, they do not add weight to the piping system as flanges do, and they do not require an increase in pipe wall thickness to compensate for threading, as threaded joints do. Pipe-Weld Joint Preparation and Design Butt Welds. The most common type of joint employed in the fabrication of welded pipe systems is the circumferential butt joint. It is the most satisfactory joint from the standpoint of stress distribution. Its general field of application is pipe to pipe, pipe to flange, pipe to valve, and pipe to fitting joints. Butt joints may be used for all sizes, but fillet-welded joints can often be used to advantage for pipe NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller. The profile of the weld edge preparations for butt welds may be any configuration the welding organization deems suitable for making an acceptable weld. However, to standardize the weld edge preparation on butt-welded commercial piping compo- nents, standard weld edge preparation profiles have been established in ASME B16.25. These weld edge preparation requirements are also incorporated into the standards governing the specific components (e.g., B16.9, B16.5, B16.34).

A.104 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS A2.22, A2.23, and A2.24 illustrate the various standard weld edge profiles for different wall thickness. On piping, the end preparation is normally done by machining or grinding. On pipe of heavier wall thicknesses, machining is generally done on post mills. On carbon and low-alloy steels, oxygen cutting and beveling are also used, particularly on pipe of wall thicknesses below ¹⁄₂ in (12 mm). However, the slag should be removed by grinding prior to welding. Because of fairly broad permissible eccentricity and size tolerances of pipe and fittings, considerable mismatch may be encountered on the inside of the piping. Limitations on fit-up tolerances are included in several piping codes. For severe service applications, internal machining may be required to yield proper fit-up. When one is machining the inside diameter, care should be taken to ensure that minimum wall requirements are not violated. Table A2.21 lists the counterbore dimensions typically specified. When piping components of unequal wall thickness are to be welded, care should be taken to provide a smooth taper toward the edge of the thicker member. The length of the taper desirable is normally 3 times the offset between the components, as outlined in ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Sections-I and III, and ASME B31.1, Power Piping Code. The two methods of alignment which are recom- mended are shown in Fig. A2.25. FIGURE A2.25 Recommended welding-end sections for pipe, valves, and fittings of unequal thickness. (a) Preferred method (centerlines coincide); (b) permissible (circumferential points only). The wall thickness of cast-steel fittings and valve bodies is normally greater than that of the pipe to which they are joined. To provide a gradual transition between piping and components, the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and the ASME

PIPING COMPONENTS A.105 Code for Pressure Piping permit the machining of the cylindrical ends of fittings and valve bodies to the nominal wall thickness of the adjoining pipe. However, in no case is the thickness of a valve permitted to be less than 0.77tmin at a distance of 1.33tmin from the weld end, where tmin is the minimum valve thickness required by ASME B16.34. The machined ends may be extended back in any manner, provided that the longitudinal section comes within the maximum slope line indi- cated in Fig. A2.25. The transition from the pipe to the fitting or valve end at the joint must be such as to avoid sharp reentrant angles and abrupt changes in slope. End Preparation for Inert-Gas Tungsten-Arc Root-Pass Welding. The pipe end bevel preparations shown in Fig. A2.24 are considered adequate for shielded metal- arc welding, but they pose some problems in inert-gas tungsten-arc welding. When this process is used, extended U or flat-land bevel preparations are considered more suitable since the extended land reduces the heat sink, thereby affording better weld penetration. The end preparations apply to inert-gas tungsten-arc welding of carbon- and low-alloy steel piping, stainless-steel piping, and most nonferrous piping materials. On aluminum piping, the flat-land bevel preparations are preferred by some fabricators. Backing Rings. Backing rings are employed in some piping systems, particularly where pipe joints are welded primarily by the shielded metal-arc welding process with covered electrodes. For example, a significant number of pipe welds for steam power plants and several other applications are made with the use of backing rings. On the other hand, in many applications backing rings are not used, since they may restrict flow, provide crevices for the entrapment of corrosive substances, enhance susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking, or introduce still other objectionable features. Thus, there is little, if any, use made of backing rings in most refinery piping, radioactive service piping, or chemical process piping. The use of backing rings is primarily confined to carbon- and low-alloy steel and aluminum piping. Carbon-steel backing rings are generally made of a mild carbon steel with a maximum carbon content of 0.20 percent and a maximum sulfur content of 0.05 percent. The latter requirement is especially important since high sulfur in deposited weld metal (which could be created by an excessive sulfur content in such rings) may cause weld cracks. Split backing rings are satisfactory for service piping systems. For the more critical service applications involving car- bon- and low-alloy steel piping, solid flat or taper-machined backing rings are preferred in accordance with the recommendations shown in Pipe Fabrication Insti- tute Standard ES1 and illustrated in Fig. A2.24 and Table A2.21. When a machined backing ring is desired, it is a general recommendation that welding ends be machined on the inside diameter in accordance with the Pipe Fabrication Institute standard for the most critical services—and then only when pierced seamless pipe that complies with the applicable specifications of the Ameri- can Society for Testing and Materials is used. Such critical services include high- pressure steam lines between boiler and turbines and high-pressure boiler feed discharge lines, as encountered in modern steam power plants. It is also recom- mended that the material of the backing ring be compatible with the chemical composition of the pipe, valve, fitting, or flange with which it is to be used. Where materials of dissimilar composition are being joined, the composition of the backing ring may be that of the lower alloy. On turned-and-bored and fusion-welded pipe, the design of the backing ring and internal machining, if any, should be a matter of agreement between the

A.106 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS customer and the fabricator. Regardless of the type of backing rings used, it is recommended that the general contour of the welding bevel shown in Fig. A2.24 be maintained. When machining piping for backing rings, the resulting wall thickness should be not less than that required for the service pressure. Wherever internal machining for machined backing rings is required on pipe and welding fittings in smaller sizes and lower schedule numbers than those listed in Table A2.21, weld metal may have to be deposited on the inside of the pipe in the area to be machined. This is to provide satisfactory contact between the machined surface on the pipe inside and the machined backing ring. For such cases, the machining dimension should be a matter of agreement between the fabricator and the purchaser. Whenever pipe and welding fittings in the sizes and schedule numbers listed in Table A2.21 have plus tolerance on the outside diameter, it also may be necessary to deposit weld metal on the inside of the pipe or welding fitting in the area to be machined. In such cases, sufficient weld metal should be deposited to result in an ID not greater than the nominal ID given in Table A2.21 for the particular pipe size and wall thickness involved. Experience indicates that machining to dimension C for the pipe size and sched- ule number listed in Table A2.21 generally will result in a satisfactory seat contact of 7/32 in (5.5 mm) minimum (approximately 75 percent minimum length of contact) between pipe and the 10�backing ring. Occasionally, however, it will be necessary to deposit weld metal on the inside diameter of the pipe or welding fitting in order to provide sufficient material for machining a satisfactory seat. In welding butt joints with backing rings, care should be exercised to ensure good fusion of the first weld pass into the backing ring in order to avoid lack of weld penetration or other types of stress-raising notches. Consumable Insert Rings.. The chemical composition of a piping base metal is established primarily to provide it with certain mechanical, physical, or corrosion resisting properties. Weldability characteristics, if considered at all, are of secondary concern. On the other hand, the chemical composition of most welding filler metals is determined with primary emphasis on producing a sound, high-quality weld. The steelmaking process employed in the manufacture of welding filler metals permits closer control of the composition range, which is usually considerably narrower than would be practical for the piping base metal where much larger tonnages of steel are involved. On some base metals, the welding together by fusion of only the base-metal compositions may lead to such welding difficulties as cracking or porosity. The addition of filler metal tends to improve weld quality. However, in inert-gas tungsten-arc welding, the addition of welding filler metal from a separate wire, which the welder feeds with one hand while manipulating the tungsten-arc torch with the other, is a cumbersome process and interferes with welding ease. The welder may leave areas with lack of penetration, which generally are considered unacceptable as can be seen, e.g., in the rules of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Since some types of serious weld defects are detected only with difficulty during inspection (if they are detected at all), it is extremely important to provide the easiest welding conditions for the welder to produce quality welds. One technique to produce high-quality welds is to employ consumable insert rings of proper composition and dimensions. Consumable insert rings which are available commercially are shown in Fig. A2.26. The three primary functions of consumable insert rings are to (1) provide the easiest welding conditions and thereby minimize the effects of undesirable welding variables caused by the ‘‘human’’ element, (2) give the most favorable weld contour to resist cracking resulting from weld-metal

The best welding conditions are ob- tained where the flat-land and extended U-bevel preparations are used. These joint preparations are particularly help- ful where welding is done in the hori- zontal fixed pipe position (5G), since they ensure a flat or slightly convex root contour and provide by far the greatest resistance to weld cracking in those alloys particularly susceptible to mi- crofissuring. The weld-root contour conditions to be expected from different bevel prepa- rations and consumable insert rings are illustrated in Fig. A2.27. Where sink is not acceptable, it is considered obliga- tory to use consumable insert rings with the special flat-land or extended U-bevel preparation. In horizontal-rolled (IG) and vertical-position (2G) welding, the FIGURE A2.26 Commercial consumable in- insert ring should be placed concentri- sert rings used in pipe welding (MIL-I-23413). cally into the beveled pipe.

On Schedule 5 for NPS less than 5. welding, the insert ring should be placed eccentric to the centerline of the pipe (as shown in Fig. A2.28). In this position, the insert ring compensates for the downward sag of the molten weld metal and aids in obtaining smooth, uniform root contour along the inner diameter and the joint. Fillet Welds Circumferential fillet-welded joints are generally used for joining pipe to socket joints in sizes NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller. Figure A2.29 illustrates three typical fillet-welded joints. These types of welds are subjected to shearing and bending stresses, and adequate penetration of the pieces being joined is essential. This is particularly important with the socket joint, since the danger of washing down the end of the hub may obscure, by reason of fair appearance, the lack of a full and sound fillet weld. This condition is one which cannot be detected in the finished weld by the usual visual inspection. Additionally, a 1/16-in (1.5-mm) gap (before welding) must be maintained between the pipe end and the base of the fitting to allow for differential expansion of the mating elements. There are service applications in which socket welds are not acceptable. Piping systems involving nuclear or radioactive service or corrosive service with solutions which promote stress corrosion cracking or concentration cell action generally

PIPING COMPONENTS A.109 require butt welds in all pipe sizes with complete weld penetration to the inside of the piping. Brazed Joints Lap or shear-type joints generally are necessary to provide capillary attraction for brazing of connecting pipe. Square- groove butt joints may be brazed, but the results are unreliable unless the ends of the pipe or tube are accurately pre- pared, plane and square, and the joint is aligned carefully, as in a jig. High strengths may be obtained with butt FIGURE A2.28 Eccentric insertion of con- joints if they are properly prepared and sumable insert ring in pipe welded in the fixed brazed. However, owing to the brittle- horizontal pipe position. ness of the brazing alloy, they are not normally applicable. The alloys generally used in brazing exhibit their greatest strength when the thickness of the alloy in the lap area is minimal. Thin alloy sections also de- velop the highest ductility. For brazing ferrous and nonferrous piping with sil- ver- and copper-base brazing alloys, the thickness of the brazing alloy in the joint generally should not be more than 0.006 in (0.15 mm) and preferably not more than 0.004 in (0.1 mm). Thicknesses less than 0.003 in (0.07 mm) may make as- sembly difficult, while those greater than 0.006 in (0.15 mm) tend to produce joints having lowered strength. The brazing of certain aluminum alloys is similar in most respects to the brazing of other materials. However, joint clearances should be greater because of a somewhat more sluggish flow of the brazing alloys. For aluminum, a clearance of 0.005 to 0.010 in (0.12 to 0.25 mm) will be found satisfactory. Care must be exercised in fitting dissimilar metals, since the joint clearance at brazing temperature is the controlling factor. In these cases, consid- eration must be given to the relative expansion rates of the materials being joined. The length of lap in a joint, the shear strength of the brazing alloy, and the average percentage of the brazing sur- FIGURE A2.29 Examples of typical fillet- welded joints. face area that normally bonds are the

A.114 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS principal factors determining the strength of brazed joints. The shear strength may be calculated by multiplying the width by the length of lap by the percentages of bond area and by taking into consideration the shear strength of the alloy used. An empirical method of determining the lap distance is to take it as twice the thickness of the thinner or weaker member joined. Normally this will provide adequate strength, but in cases of doubt, the fundamental calculations should be em- ployed. Such detailed determinations are generally unnecessary for brazed piping, since commercial brazing fittings are available in which the length of lap is predetermined at a safe value. For brass and copper pipe, cast or wrought bronze and wrought copper fittings are available. A bore of correct depth to accept the pipe is provided, and midway down this bore may be a groove into which, at the time of manufacture, a ring of brazing alloy is inserted. Since the alloy is preplaced in fittings with such a groove, separate feeding of brazing alloy by hand is generally unnecessary. JOINING DUCTILE OR CAST-IRON PIPE Bell-and-Spigot Joint This joint for underground cast-iron pipe was developed as long ago as 1785. Standard dimensions are shown in Table A2.22. The joint may be made up with lead and oakum, sulfur compounds, or cement. Lead and oakum constitute the prevailing joint sealer for sanitary systems. Bell- and-spigot joints are usually reserved for sanitary sewer systems. These joints are not used in ductile iron pipe. Mechanical (Gland-Type) Joint This modification of the bell-and-spigot joints, as designated in Federal Specification WW-P-421 and ANSI/AWWA C111/A21.11, is illustrated in Table A2.23. This joint is commonly used for low and intermediate-pressure gas distribution systems, particularly those conveying natural gas or dry manufactured gas. Mechanical joints are also used for water lines, sewage, and process piping. In the mechanical (gland-type) joint shown in Fig. A2.30, the lead and oakum of the conventional bell-and-spigot joint are supplanted by a stuffing box in which a rubber or composition pack- ing ring, with or without a metal or can- vas tip or canvas backing, is compressed by a ductile cast-iron follower ring drawn up with bolts. In addition to making an inherently tight joint even under consid- erable pressure, this arrangement has the advantage of permitting relatively large lateral deflections (3¹⁄₂�to 7�), as well as longitudinal expansion or con- traction. For more details, refer to AWWA C600, Standard for Installation of Ductile-Iron Water Mains and Their FIGURE A2.30 Mechanical (gland-type) joint Appurtenances. for cast-iron pipe.

PIPING COMPONENTS A.115 Tyton Joint The Tyton joint is designed to contain an elongated grooved gasket. The inside contour of the socket bell provides a seat for the circular rubber in a modified bulb- shaped gasket. An internal ridge in the socket fits into the groove of the gasket. A slight taper on the plain end of the pipe facilitates assembly. Standard dimensions are given in Table A2.24. The maximum joint deflection angle is 5�for sizes through NPS 12 (DN 300), 4�for NPS 14 (DN 350) and NPS 16 (DN 400), and 3�for NPS 18 (DN 450), NPS 20 (DN 500), and NPS 24 (DN 600). Either all-bell U.S. standardized mechanical joint fittings or bell-and-spigot all-bell fittings with poured or cement joints can be used with Tyton joint pipe. Mechanical Lock-Type Joint For installations where the joints may tend to come apart owing to sag or lateral thrust in the pipeline, a mechanical joint having a self-locking feature is used to resist end pull. This joint is similar to the gland-type mechanical joint except that in the locked joint the spigot end of the pipe is grooved or has a recess to grip the gasket. Although only slight expansion or contraction can be accommodated in this type of joint, it does allow the usual 3¹⁄₂�to 7�angular deflection. The lock-type joint finds application aboveground in the process industries and in river crossings on bridges or trestles, as well as in submarine crossings or in unusually loose or known marshy soils. Where the locking feature is on the spigot rather than on the bell, this type of pipe can be used with the regular line of mechanical joint fittings. Mechanical Push-On-Type Joint Where a low-cost mechanical joint is desired, the roll-on type can be used. In this joint, a round rubber gasket is placed over the spigot end and is pulled into the bell by mechanical means, thus pulling the ring into place in the bottom of the bell. Outside the rubber gasket, braided jute is wedged behind a projecting ridge in the bell. This serves to confine the gasket under pressure in the joint. A bituminous compound is used to seal the mouth of the bell and to aid in retaining the hemp and the rubber gasket. Either bell-and-spigot or mechanical (gland-type) fittings are used with this line of pipe. Push-on joints are made in accordance with ANSI/ AWWA C111/A21.11. Mechanical Screw-Gland-Type Joint This type of mechanical joint for cast-iron pipe makes use of a coarse-threaded screw gland drawn up by means of a spanner wrench to compress a standard rubber or composition packing gasket. The joint allows from 2�to 7�angular deflection, as well as expansion or contraction without danger of leaks. A lead ring, inserted in the bell ahead of the gasket, seals off the contents of the line from the gasket. The ring also provides an electric circuit through the joint for thawing out frozen underground mains and service lines by the electrical method. The screw-gland joint is used in piping which conveys water, gas, oil, and other fluids at considerable pressure. The gaskets and lead rings are interchangeable with those used in equiva- lent lines of mechanical joints of the bolted-gland type. A full line of fittings is available for use with screw-gland pipe.

PIPING COMPONENTS A.117 Ball-and-Socket Joints For river crossings, submarine lines, or other places where great flexibility is necessary, ductile cast-iron pipe can be obtained with ball-and-socket joints of the mechanical-gland types, as shown in Fig. A2.31. Provision is made for longitu- dinal expansion and contraction, and a positive stop against disengagement of FIGURE A2.31 Ball-and-socket mechanical the joint is a feature of the design. As joint for cast-iron pipe. much as 15�angular deflection can be accommodated without leakage. This pipe is heavy enough to remain underwater where laid without requiring river clamps or anchorage devices. The pipe may be pulled across streams with a cable, since the joints are positively locked against separating, or it may be laid directly from a barge, bridge, or pontoons, without the services of a diver. The mechanical ball-and-socket joint is suitable for use with water, sewage, air, gas, oil, and other fluids at considerable pressure. Either bell-and-spigot or mechanical (gland-type) fittings can be used with this line of pipe, although the integral ball present on the spigot end of some designs has to be cut off before the pipe can be inserted in a regular bell. Universal Pipe Joints This type of cast-iron pipe joint (shown in Fig. A2.32) has a machined taper seat which obviates the need for caulking or for a compression gasket. The joint is pulled up snugly with two bolts, after which the nuts are backed off slightly, thus enabling the lock washers to give FIGURE A2.32 Universal cast-iron pipe joint. enough to avoid overstressing the socket or lugs. Pipe is made in 12- to 20-ft (3.5- to 6-m) lengths to the usual pressure classes and can be bought as Type III under Federal Specification WW-P-421. Universal-joint fittings are available for use with the pipe. This type of joint is used to some extent in pipe diameters of NPS 4 (DN 100) to NPS 24 (DN 600) for underground water supply systems; but it is not considered suitable for gas service, and it does not permit much angular displacement or expansive movement. Compression-Sleeve Coupling The type of joint shown in Fig. A2.33 is used with plain-end pipe of either cast iron or steel. It is widely known under the trade names of Dresser coupling and Dayton coupling. Compression sleeve couplings are used extensively for air, gas, oil, water, and other services above- or underground. With a joint of this type, it is necessary to anchor or brace solidly at dead ends or turns to prevent the line from pulling apart. Compression couplings and fittings with screwed packing glands are available for use with small-size cast-iron or steel pipe. In welded transmission lines for oil or gas where any significant change in temperature is expected, a certain

Grooved Segmented-Ring Coupling The type of split coupling shown in Fig. A2.34 is used with either ductile cast-iron or steel pipe that has grooves near the ends which enable the coupling to grip the pipe, in order to prevent disengagement of the joint. The couplings are manufactured in a minimum of two segments for small pipe sizes and several segments for large pipe sizes. Grooved-end fittings are available for use with the couplings.

The coupling is also available in a style where grooving of the pipe ends is not required. Joint separation is prevented by the use of hardened steel inserts (teeth) which grab the mating pipe ends. Flanged Joints Flanged ductile or cast-iron pipe is used aboveground for low and intermediate pressures in water-pumping stations, gas works, power and industrial plants, oil refineries, booster stations for water, and gas and oil transmission lines. Cast iron flanges usually are faced and drilled according to ASME B16.1. For flanged joints in a ductile iron pipe, refer to ASME B16.42, ANSI/AWWA C110/A21.10, C111/ A21.11, C115/A21.15, and C153/A21.53. Cast-iron pipe is made both with integrally cast flanges and with threaded companion flanges for screwing onto the pipe (as shown in Figs. A2.35 and A2.36). In the latter case, the outside diameter of the pipe conforms to iron pipe size (IPS) dimensions to allow for the threads provided. It is available in sizes NPS 3 (DN 50) through NPS 24 (DN 600) and in length to 18 ft (5.5 m). For lengths less than 3 ft (1 m), in sizes NPS 3 (DN 50) through NPS 12 (DN 300), the flanges may be cast integrally with the pipe, rather than screwed on the pipe, at the manufacturer’s option. Standard dimensions of flanged joints for silver brazing are shown in Table A2.25. CONCRETE, CEMENT, AND CEMENT-LINED PIPE Nonreinforced Concrete Pipe Nonreinforced concrete pipe for the conveyance of sewage, industrial waste, and storm water is made in sizes from NPS 4 to NPS 36 (DN 100 to DN 900). It is produced in accordance with ASTM Specification C14, Standard Specifications for Concrete Sewer Storm Drain and Culvert Pipe. Nonreinforced-concrete drain tile is used for land drainage and for subsurface drainage of highways, railroads, airports, and buildings. It is made in sizes from NPS 4 through 36 (DN 100 through 900) in accordance with ASTM Specification C412, Standard Specification for Concrete Drain Tile, and AASHO M178, Standard Specification for Concrete Drain Tile. Drain tile is available in the standard quality, extra-quality, and special-quality classifications. Perforated concrete pipe used for under-drainage is made in accordance with ASTM Specification C444, Specifications for Perforated Concrete Pipe. This pipe is also made in sizes NPS 4 through 36 (DN 100 through 900) and is available in the standard-strength and extra-strength classification. Concrete irrigation pipe, used for the conveyance of irrigation water under low hydrostatic heads and for land drainage, is made in sizes NPS 4 through 24 (DN 100 through 600) in accordance with ASTM Specification C118, Standard Specifica- tions for Concrete Pipe for Irrigation or Drainage. Nonreinforced-concrete irrigation pipe for use with rubber-type gasket joints is made for conveyance of irrigation water at water pressures of 1 bar (35 ft of head) or higher depending on the diameter. Such pipe is made in sizes NPS 6 through 24 (DN 100 through 600) in accordance with ASTM Specification C505, Specifica-

Reinforced-Concrete Pipe Reinforced-concrete pipe for the conveyance of sewage, industrial wastes, and storm water and for the construction of culverts is made in sizes from NPS 12 to 144 (DN 300 through 3600). Reinforced-concrete pipe may or may not be manufactured for use with rubber gaskets to seal the joints. It is usually manufactured in accordance with the following specifications: ●ASTM C76, Specifications for Reinforced Concrete Culvert, Storm Drain and Sewer Pipe ●AASHO M170, Specifications for Reinforced Concrete Culvert, Storm Drain and Sewer Pipe ●Federal SS-P-375-Pipe, Concrete (Reinforced, Sewer) Reinforced-concrete pipe may be made with either tongue-and-groove or bell- and-spigot joints. When made for use with rubber gaskets, the joints must conform to ASTM Specification C443 or AASHO Specification M198, Specifications for Joints for Circular Concrete Sewer and Culvert Pipe, Using Flexible Watertight, Rubber-Type Gaskets. Concrete pipe is available also in both an arch and an elliptical cross section. These pipes are made in accordance with the following specifications: ●ASTM C506, Specifications for Reinforced Concrete Arch Culvert, Storm Drain and Sewer Pipe ●ASTM C507, Specifications for Reinforced Concrete Elliptical Culvert, Storm Drain and Sewer Pipe In each of the standards covering reinforced-concrete pipe, five strength classes are defined in terms of minimum three-edge bearing load at a crack width of 0.01 in (0.25 mm) and at the ultimate strength of the pipe. The strength class required for a given installation is determined by computing the earth load and live load which will be transferred to the pipe under the conditions anticipated. This load is then converted to an equivalent three-edge bearing load by dividing it by a bedding factor. The bedding factor depends upon installation conditions and is always greater than 1.0.

PIPING COMPONENTS A.123 quantities of cement-lined steel pipe are used for other applications where corrosion is more of a problem. The largest user, by far, is the petroleum industry in oil field flow lines, pipelines, tubing, and casing. Cement-lined pipe is particularly suitable for these applications because of the presence in the oil fields of saltwater, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other corrosive material. Other applications include lines in salt works for handling brine, discharge lines in coal mines for carrying highly corrosive sulfur water, lines in paper and pulp mills for handling diluted acids and corrosive waste liquids, and lines in process plants where water or other liquids must be kept free from iron contamination or rust. Cement-lined pipe is generally joined with screwed seal rings which prevent the corrosive liquid from coming in contact with steel. Flanged joints are also extensively used. Some prefabrication is done of piping assemblies involving welding of the steel joints. Field joining of the preassembled welded assemblies is then done with flanged ends. Cement of course must not be at the pipe ends being welded. After welding, these ends are filled with mortar.

CHAPTER A3 PIPING MATERIALS James M. Tanzosh Supervisor, Materials Engineering Babcock & Wilcox Barberton, Ohio The selection of materials for piping applications is a process that requires consider- ation of material characteristics appropriate for the required service. Material se- lected must be suitable for the flow medium and the given operating conditions of temperature and pressure safely during the intended design life of the product. Mechanical strength must be appropriate for long-term service, and resist opera- tional variables such as thermal or mechanical cycling. Extremes in application temperature can raise issues with material capabilities ranging from brittle fracture toughness at low temperatures to adequacy of creep strength and oxidation resis- tance at the other end of the temperature spectrum. In addition, the operating environment surrounding the pipe or piping compo- nent must be considered. Degradation of material properties or loss of effective load-carrying cross section can occur through corrosion, erosion, or a combination of the two. The nature of the substances that are contained by the piping is also an important factor. The fabricability characteristics of the materials being considered must also be taken into account. The ability to be bent or formed, suitability for welding or other methods of joining, ease of heat treatment, and uniformity and stability of the resultant microstructure and properties all of a given piping material contribute toward or detract from its attractiveness and economy. The selection process should lead to the most economical material that meets the requirements of the service conditions and codes and standards that apply. Applicable design and construction codes such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and the ASME B31 Pressure Piping Code identify acceptable materials for piping systems within their jurisdiction. These codes specify the design rules, allowable design stresses, and other properties required to accomplish the design task. However, the information supplied is generally only adequate and intended to assure safe operation under the thermal and mechanical conditions expected under steady-state and sometimes (as in nuclear construction) cyclic operation. These codes do not directly and explicitly address the many other environmental and material degradation issues that should be considered by design and materials engineers in arriving at a piping system that is not only safe to operate but will A.125

A.126 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS offer long-term, reliable service and function. Thus, simply designing to ‘‘the Code’’ when selecting materials can sometimes lead to premature end-of-life of piping system components. This chapter will attempt to identify the important metallurgical characteristics of piping materials and how they can affect or be affected by operation of all of the other materials available to the engineer. Carbon and low-alloy steels come closest to being the ideal construction material. Due to the fact that the majority of piping applications employ iron-based metals, these will be emphasized in this chapter. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF PIPING MATERIALS The behavior of piping material can be understood and predicted by studying a number of properties of the material. Appreciation of how a material will perform must extend all the way down to the atomic components of the material. Metals are crystalline in structure, composed of atoms in precise locations within a space lattice. The smallest component of the crystalline structure is called a unit cell, the smallest repeating building block of the material. For example, iron and iron-based alloys exist in two unit cell forms, the body-centered cubic (BCC) and the face- FIGURE A3.1 The three most common crystal structures in met- als and alloys. (a) Face-centered cubic (FCC); (b) body-centered cubic (BCC); (c) hexagonal close-packed (HCP). centered cubic (FCC) structure, shown in Fig. A3.1. They are differentiated in the way the atoms are arranged in repeating patterns. The body-centered cubic structure is represented by a cube with atoms at all eight corners, and one atom in the center of the cube. The face-centered lattice is represented by atoms at the eight corners of the cube, plus one atom located at the center of each of the cube’s six faces. The crystal structure naturally assumed by a material dictates some of the fundamental properties of the material. For example, FCC materials are generally more ductile than BCC materials. This is basically because FCC crystals are the most tightly packed of metallic structures and, as such, allow for more planes of atoms to slide across one another with the least amount of resistance (the fundamental atomic motion involved in what is called plasticity). Metallic materials consist of these and other ordered crystal structures. Some metals, most notably iron, change their crystal structure as temperature varies.

PIPING MATERIALS A.127 Structure may also change as certain other elements are added in the form of alloying additions. These changes are used to advantage by metallurgists and are the basis for developing and manipulating important material behavior, such as the heat treatability of carbon and low alloy steels. Plastics may be defined as synthetic materials whose chief component is a resin or resin equivalent. The term plastic covers a very broad range of materials that contain, as an essential ingredient, one or more organic polymetic substances. They possess large molecular weight, formed by the chemical combination of carbon- hydrogen atom chains (monomers to polymers). The atomic structure is thus ordered and predictable, but dissimilar from that of metals. Many plastics have greater strength per unit weight than metal, but suffer due to lower impact strength, chemical stability, and thermal and aging stability. However, plastics fill an important niche in the piping engineer’s repertoire. Ceramic materials are composed of the oxides of metal arranged in ordered atomic structures similar to that of metals. The atomic constituents are electronically different, resulting in rigid, predictable behavior, but with an inherent lack of plasticity compared to metals. Glasses form the other extreme of the atomic structure spectrum. Their atomic makeup is essentially that of a liquid; the structure is actually a solid with no ordered arrangement of atoms. These atomic characteristics (i.e., the natural arrangement of the atoms, as well as the specific elements involved and their electronic characteristics) establish the fundamental properties of engineering materials. The properties that a engineer requires to design and construct a piping system are a manifestation of the longer- range effects of atomic structure. These properties fall into three categories: chemi- cal, mechanical, and physical. Chemical Properties of Metals Chemical properties are herein defined as those material characteristics that are dictated by the elemental constituency of the solid. This is usually measured by the relative atomic weight percent of the various elements (metals or nonmetals) or compounds within the material. Metals are are not usually used in their pure form. Rather, secondary elements are purposely added to improve or modify their behavior. This addition of secondary elements is called alloying, and the elements added fall into two categories, based on the relative size of the atoms. Atoms significantly smaller than those of the parent metal matrix fit into spaces between the atoms in the lattices’ interstices and are called interstitial alloying elements. Carbon added to iron, creating steel, is the most common example. Larger-sized atoms will substitute for parent metal atoms in their matrix locations, thus the name substitutional alloying elements. Examples of this include zinc substituting for copper atoms in copper, creating brass; and tin substituting for copper atoms, creating bronze alloys. Pure metals possess relatively low strength. Adding an alloying element will increase the strength of a metal’s atomic matrix because the atomic lattice is strained locally by the foreign atom, creating a larger impediment for the sliding of planes of atoms across one another during plastic flow. This is true whether the alloying element is interstitial or substitutional; however, the former generally serve as better lattice strengtheners. Strength properties are often improved to the detriment of ductility. Proper alloying, combined with appropriate metal processing and heat treatment, results in optimization of material properties.

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.128 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Elements are also added to metals to improve or modify their corrosion or oxidation characteristics, or to improve manufacturability (e.g., machineability) and/or electrical properties, among other effects. However, it is important to note that alloying done to optimize one material property may act to the detriment of others. Carbon steels, the most common of the construction materials, always contain the elements carbon, manganese, phosphorous, sulfur, and silicon in varying amounts. Small amounts of other elements may be found either entering as gases during the steel-making process (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen), or introduced through the ores or metal scrap used to make the steel (nickel, copper, molybdenum, chromium, tin, antimony, etc.). The specific effect of each of these elements on steel properties will be addressed later in the chapter. Addition of significant quantities of the interstitial element carbon will result in high strength and hardness—but to the detriment of formability and weldability. A great amount of research has gone into the development of the principal metals used in piping design and construction; thus the specification limits must be vigorously adhered to in order to assure reliability, predictability, and repeatability of material behavior. The number of elements alloyed with a parent metal, and the acceptable range of content of each, are identified in the material specification (e.g., ASTM, API, ASME). Tests appropriate for determining the elemental constituency of an alloy have been standardized and are also described in ASTM specifications. The material specifications also stipulate whether the chemical analysis of an alloy may be re- ported by analyzing a sample of the molten metal, or taken from a specimen removed from the final product. The former is commonly referred to as a ladle analysis, and the latter as a product or check analysis. This ‘‘chemistry’’ of a construc- tion material is reported on a material test report which may be supplied by the material manufacturer upon request. Mechanical Properties of Metals Mechanical properties are critically important to the design process. They are defined as the characteristic response of a material to applied force. The standardized test methods for measuring these properties are described in ASTM specifications. Properties fall into two general categories, strength and ductility. Some proper- ties, such as material toughness, are dependent on both strength and ductility. The most widely known and used material properties, as defined by ASTM, are described in the following paragraphs.1 Modulus of Elasticity (Young’s Modulus). The modulus of elasticity is the ratio of normal stress to corresponding strain for tensile or compressive stresses. This ratio is linear through a range of stress, known as Hooke’s law. The material behavior in this range is elastic (i.e., if the applied load is released the material will return to its original, unstressed shape). The value of the slope in the elastic range is defined as Young’s Modulus. The modulus of elasticity is measured using the tension test, the most widely used test applied to engineering materials. The test consists of applying a gradually increasing load in either tension or compression, in a testing machine, to a standard- ized test specimen (Fig. A3.2). The applied load is continuously monitored, as is test specimen elongation or contraction under load. These measured quantities are generally represented on a coordinate axis, called a stress-strain curve (Fig. A3.3). The modulus of elasticity and other strength properties are established from this

PIPING MATERIALS A.129 curve. Values of the modulus of elastic- ity for a number of construction materi- als are given in Table A3.1 Yield Strength. When a specimen is loaded beyond the point where elastic behavior can be maintained the speci- men will begin to deform in a plastic manner. Most materials do not abruptly transform from purely elastic to purely plastic behavior. Rather, a gradual tran- sition occurs as represented by a curve, or knee, in the stress-strain curve. Lack- ing an abrupt and easily definable point representing transition from elastic to plastic behavior, several standardized methods have been defined by ASTM to determine the yield strength used as the engineering property. The most common is termed the 0.2 percent offset method. In this approach a line is drawn FIGURE A3.2 Tension-test specimens.

(Fig. A3.4). The yield strength corresponds to the calcu- lated value of the load indicated at the intersection point of the drawn line, di- vided by the original cross-sectional area in the gauge length of the tensile speci- men. By convention, this test is per- formed at a constant rate of strain, and is reported as newtons per square meter, or as pounds per square inch of cross FIGURE A3.3 Stress-strain diagram. section in English units. Ultimate Tensile Strength. Upon further increase of applied load under constant strain rate, the specimen will continue to stretch until the loss of load-carrying cross section caused by specimen thinning during the test (due to Poisson’s ratio) cannot withstand further load increase. The ultimate tensile strength constitutes the maximum applied load divided by the original specimen cross-sectional area. Elongation and Reduction of Area. The ductility of the test specimen can be established by measuring its length and minimum diameter before and after testing. Stretch of the specimen is represented as a percent elongation in a given length (usually 2 or 8 in) and is calculated in the following manner:

Another standard measure of ductility is the reduction of area of the specimen, defined as follows: Hardness. This is a measure of the material’s ability to resist deformation, usually determined by a standardized test where the surface resistance to indentation is measured. The most common hardness tests are defined by the indentor type and size, and the amount of load applied. The hardness numbers constitute a non- dimensioned, arbitrary scale, with in- creasing numbers representing harder surfaces. The two most common hard- ness test methods are Brinell Hardness and Rockwell Hardness, with each rep- resenting a standardized test machine with its own unique hardness scales. Hardness loosely correlates with ulti- mate tensile strength in metals (Fig. A3.5). Approximate hardness conver- sion numbers for a variety of material types, including steels, can be found in ASTM Specification E140. FIGURE A3.4 Offset method of determining yield strength. Toughness. Sudden fracture, exhib- iting little ductility in the vicinity of the break, occurs in certain metals when load is rapidly applied. The capability of a material to resist such a brittle fracture is a measure of its toughness. Highly ductile materials (those possessing an FCC lattice, for example) exhibit considerable toughness across a full range of temperatures. Other materials, such as BCC-based carbon steels, possess a level of toughness that is dependent on the metal temperature when the load is applied. In these metals, a transition from brittle to ductile behavior occurs over a narrow range of temperatures. The two most common methods used to measure metal toughness are the Charpy

(SAE Hand- book, 1964.) Impact test, defined in ASTM specification E 23, and the Drop-Weight test, defined in ASTM E 208. The Charpy test employs a small machined specimen with a machined notch that is struck by a pendulum weight (Fig. A3.6). The energy loss to the pendulum as it passes through and breaks the specimen (Fig. A3.7), measured in kilojoules or ft �lb of force, is a measure of the toughness of the specimen. Typical impact behavior versus test temperature is shown in Fig. A3.8. The Drop-Weight test is similar in principle but employs a larger specimen with a brittle, notched weld bead used as the crack starter (Fig. A3.9). A weight is dropped from a height onto the specimen, which had been cooled or heated to the desired test temperature. The test determines the nil-ductility transition temperature (NDTT), defined as the specimen temperature when, upon striking, the crack propa- gates across the entire specimen width. The Charpy brittle transition temperature (sometimes called the Charpy fix temperature) and the Drop Weight NDTT are both important design considerations for those materials that can exhibit poor toughness and that may operate in lower temperature regimes. In pressure vessel and piping design codes, limits are placed on material minimum use temperature based on adding an increment of margin over and above the Charpy fix or NDTT. Operating at or above this elevated temperature is then usually sufficient to avoid brittle, catastrophic failure, as for example is the case when at a temperature on the ‘‘upper shelf’’ of the Charpy V- notch toughness-versus-temperature curve.

The ability of a metal to resist crack initiation and further propagation under repeated cyclic loading is a measure of its fatigue resistance. Several standardized test methods have been developed to test metals, machined to particular geometries, where applying a repeating load range. Loads are generally applied through bending, cantilevered, or push-pull load application in suitably outfitted testing machines. Either constant applied stress or strain ranges can be employed to determine material response. The most common representation of fatigue test data is an S-N curve, relating stress (S) required to cause specimen failure in a given number of cycles (N) (Fig. FIGURE A3.8 Transition temperature range and transition temperature in Charpy impact test.

(ASTM Spec- ification E208.) A3.10a). These tests are generally performed on smooth specimens, but they can also be run with stress-concentrating mechanisms such as notches machined into the specimen surface. The effect of stress concentrations on fatigue life cycles can also be estimated from the smooth specimen S-N curve by calculating the intensified stress due to the particular geometry, and intersecting the curve at that point on the stress axis. As the applied load range decreases, ferritic steels exhibit a point at which an infinite number of cycles can be absorbed without causing failure. This level of stress is called the endurance limit. Many of the other metals do not exhibit this behavior, but rather exhibit an increasing, but finite, number of cycles to failure with decreasing cyclic load (Fig. A3.10b). The fatigue resistance of a material at a given applied stress or strain range is a function of a number of variables, including material strength and ductility. Results may vary significantly for different surface finishes, product forms of the same material (Fig. A3.11), material internal cleanliness, test specimen orientation, and levels of residual stress, among other factors. Variations in the test environment can also have a profound effect on test results (Fig. A3.12). Therefore, fatigue test results characteristically exhibit significant scatter. Fatigue design curves are generated from test data by applying large safety margins to the average property curve. In U.S. design codes, the fatigue design curve is commonly generated by taking the lesser of ¹⁄₂₀ times the cycles to failure, or ¹⁄₂ of the stress to cause failure. A new curve is constructed taking the lower bound of these two factored curves. When considering metal fatigue in design, a further safety margin is often also applied against the cycles-to-failure at a given stress amplitude. For example, if a component is continuously cycled over the same stress range, a design limit on allowable cycles may correspond to the cycle life multiplied by a factor such as 0.8. This is a common safety margin employed in vessel and piping design. As is normally the case, components may experience a wide variety of cyclic

The effect of this array of cyclic parameters on fatigue life can be estimated by an approach referred to as life fraction summation. In this design practice, the percentage of life used up in cycling at a certain stress range is calculated, corresponding to the ratio of the number of actual service duty cycles to the total number of cycles to failure at that

A heating cham- ber is combined with a conventional tensile testing machine, and special strain measuring extensometers are used that are capable of withstanding the test tempera- tures. Generally, as temperature increases, yield and ultimate strengths decrease, and ductility increases. Creep is defined as the time-dependent deformation of a material that occurs under load at elevated temperatures. The test is performed by holding a specimen, similar in configuration to a tensile specimen, at a uniform temperature and a constant load (usually using a dead weight) and allowing the specimen to gradually elongate to ultimate failure. The practice is defined in ASTM Specification E 139. The simplest test method records only the applied stress (based on original test specimen cross section), time to failure, and total elongation at failure. This is called a stress rupture test. If periodic measurements of strain accumulation versus test duration are also taken, the test is referred to as a creep-rupture test. A representation of typical creep strain-versus-time data is shown in Fig. A3.13. Three stages of creep behavior are exhibited. Upon initial loading, instantaneous straining occurs. Almost immediately, the rate of creep strain accumulation (creep rate) is high but continuously decreasing. The test then progresses into a phase where the strain rate slows and becomes fairly constant for a long period of time. Finally, with decreasing load-bearing cross section of the specimen due to specimen stretching and necking, applied stress begins to increase steadily, as does the creep rate, until failure occurs. These three regions are termed the primary, secondary, and tertiary stages of creep. The intent of safe design practice is to avoid the third stage, where strain accumulations are rapid and material behavior less predictable.

PIPING MATERIALS A.139 After accumulating a number of rup- ture data points (i.e., time to failure of a metal at various applied stresses), the data is generally represented as a stress rupture curve (Fig. A3.14). Each curve represents the time to failure at various applied stresses, at a given test tempera- ture. Another useful property that can be measured in these tests is the creep rate during the second stage of creep, for a given applied stress and temperature. This, along with time to onset of the tertiary creep stage, are useful proper- ties to the design engineer and are used in establishing allowable design tension FIGURE A3.14 Typical stress-to-rupture stresses in design codes. curves. Metals that experience creep will ac- cumulate a progressively larger amount of microscopic damage to the structure of the material. Damage is first observed microscopically as small cavities, or voids, that begin appearing in the grain bound- aries of the metal, particularly at triple points (i.e., where three grains come to- gether). Further progression of damage entails formation of more voids along many of the adjacent grain boundaries, until ultimately they link together to form grain boundary microcracks. With more time, these form larger macrocracks that lead to ultimate failure of the metal component. The determination of a metal’s degree of creep damage, and its consequence on the continued safe operation of the component, has developed into a sophisticated science referred to as component condition assessment, or estimation of remaining life. This will be addressed in more detail later in the chapter. A practice essentially identical to cyclic fraction life summation used in fatigue design can be employed in material creep analysis to estimate the percentage of creep life expended. Here the individual life fraction corresponds to the amount of time a component spends at a given stress and temperature, compared to the total time to failure given on the stress rupture curve for the same applied stress and temperature. All of these fractions for all the operating conditions are then added together, and compared to an appropriate design limit (1.0 or less). Physical Properties of Metals Physical properties are those, other than mechanical properties, that pertain to the physics of a material. Physical properties of importance to the materials and design engineer are material density, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and spe- cific heat.2 Density. Density is the ratio of the mass of a material to its volume. In vessel and piping design, the density of a construction material versus its strength per unit area of cross section is often an important consideration. Thermal Conductivity. This is the characteristic ability of a material to transmit energy in the form of heat from a high-temperature source to a point of lower temperature. The ability to transmit heat is usually expressed as a coefficient of

For example: The lower the value of k, the more resistant the material is to the flow of thermal energy. Good insulators possess low coefficients of thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity is a function of the temperature of the material. For example, the coefficient of thermal conductivity of carbon steel decreases as its temperature increases, thereby decreasing its ability to transfer heat energy. Austen- itic stainless steels, on the other hand, increase in k value with temperature. How- ever, they remain lower than carbon steels in normal piping system temperature ranges. Thermal Expansion. Expressed as the coefficient of linear expansion, thermal expansion is a ratio of the change in length per degree of temperature, to a length at a given standard temperature (such as room temperature, or the freezing point of water). The units of the coefficient are length of growth per unit length per degree of temperature. The value of the coefficient varies with temperature. Specific Heat. This is a measure of the quantity of heat required to raise a unit weight of a material one degree in temperature. Some values of physical properties of a number of materials of interest are given in Table A3.2 and Table A3.3.

Other Metallurgical Properties of Metals In addition to the properties already described, other characteristics of metals can have an important effect on the design process. These may profoundly affect the uniformity, achievable level, or stability of mechanical strength and ductility over long periods of usage. Grain Size. Upon solidification from the molten state, metals take crystalline form. Rather than a single, large crystal, the material consists of many small crystals that initiate independently and nearly simultaneously from separate nuclei sites. These individual crystals are called grains, and their outer surfaces are called grain boundaries. Grains form initially during the solidification process, but they may also reform, grow, or rearrange while in the solid state. Some properties of many engineering metals are very dependent on grain size (Fig. A3.15). For example, austenitic stainless steels, such as Type 304 (18% Cr-8% Ni-Fe), possess excellent creep strength when the material has a coarse grain structure, but very poor strength with fine (small) grains. FIGURE A3.15 Sketch illustrating individual If this same austenitic material is plas- grain growth from nuclei and dendrites. tically cold-worked, these grains will be- come distorted and possess high levels of lattice strain and residual stress. Subsequent heat treatment can cause the crystal lattice to reform unstrained grains initiating at lattice defects which act as nuclei. The process, called recrystallization, results in an initially very small grain size as the nucleated stress-free grains begin to grow. If heavily strained material is placed into elevated temperature service at temperatures sufficient to cause recrystalliza- tion, it will initially exhibit good creep strength until the grains begin to reform,

A.146 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS upon which the result is very poor creep rupture strength. The material will only return to its prestrained creep-strength level if additional heat treatment is per- formed, resulting in further grain growth. Grain size is a material characteristic that is sometimes directly inspected in the base material testing and certification process. The test entails retrieving a piece of the material and then metallographically polishing and etching the specimen with a weak acid solution, which reveals the grain boundaries under magnification. The test is described in ASTM Specification E 112. Grain size can be measured and reported a number of ways. The most commonly used method involves reporting grain size as an ASTM grain size number (n), corresponding to the exponent of the following equation: ASTM has correlated this grain size number, which increases as grain diameter decreases, to a series of photographs representing the grain structure at 100 magnifi- cations. The grain size number can then be estimated by visual comparison. Exam- ples of this comparative standard are shown in Fig. A3.16. Fine-grained carbon- and low-alloy steels tend to possess better notch toughness and ductility than coarse-grained steel. As noted earlier, as operating temperature increases into the creep regime, engineering material strength properties are usually enhanced with coarser grains. Although this is an oversimplified (and perhaps overstated) rule of thumb, it is important for the engineer to take grain size into account for critical structures. Hardenability. This is a property of certain steels that allows them to be strength- ened, or hardened, by heat treating. In carbon and alloy steels, for example, this hardening is accomplished by heating the material to a temperature above about 1550�F (843�C), where the material completely changes its crystal structure from BCC to FCC. When this is followed by rapid cooling or quenching, usually in water or oil, the result is a crystal structure akin to the original BCC, but distorted along one of the unit cell directions. In the case of steels the result is a martensitic structure possessing a lattice, termed a body-centered tetragonal (BCT), with a larger volume per unit cell than the starting BCC. The maximum hardness achieved in a quenched structure is primarily a function of the steel’s carbon content: the higher the carbon content, the greater the hardness. The depth into the material to which a high hardness is achieved for a given quenching operation is a function of the total alloy content within the steel. The substitutional alloying element nickel has perhaps the strongest effect on increasing the depth to which hardness extends.3 Other elements creating similar if less potent effects are manganese and boron, substitutional and interstitial alloying ele- ments, respectively. Standard specimens and procedures have been adopted for testing the harden- ability of steels. The test rates a combination of the highest hardness achievable and the depth to which significant elevation of hardness occurs. It is called the Jominy End-Quench test and is performed using a 1-in-diameter cylindrical specimen machined from the metal in question and heated to a temperature in its austenitic phase (FCC) region. The heated specimen is removed from the heating oven and quickly set in a water-quenching fixture, operating under prescribed conditions of water temperature and flow rate, quenching only the cylinder end face. Upon cooling, the cylinder is parted longitudinally (axially) down the center, and a series of Rockwell hardness readings are taken from the quenched edge. A hardness scan

The Jominy test procedure is defined in ASTM A 255. Many other metal alloys harden or strengthen with special aging or tempering heat treatments. However, this trait is normally not referred to as hardenability. These will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter. Property Stability. The mechanical properties of materials may degrade with service time. In particular, alloys that depend on heat treatment or cold working

(Molybdenum Steels Iron Alloys, Archer et al., Climax Molybdenum Company.) to develop their strength may weaken if operated for long times at elevated tempera- tures. The actual exposure to service temperatures acts as a continuation of the heat- treating process, albeit at a significantly reduced rate of effect. In many engineering metals, this effect is actually a property degradation due to overtempering of the material. A number of thermodynamic relationships exist that relate material strength and time and temperature of exposure for carbon and alloy steels. The most famous and widely used of these is the Hollomon-Jaffe Parameter (HJP). It is defined as the following: where T is temperature in degrees Celsius, t is time in hours, and C is a constant, usually around 20 for carbon steels.4 Using this equation and solving for HJP for a given set of time and temperature conditions, the engineer can determine the time at a different temperature of interest that can result in an equivalent metallurgi- cal effect. A limitation exists on the range of temperatures over which the predictive capability of the Holloman-Jaffe equation can be considered reliable. Phenomino- logically, the same metallurgical processes must be in effect over the range of temperatures under consideration. For example, if a phase change occurs, or if other important microstructural constituents, such as carbides, are not stable at the two temperatures being compared, the correlation is not valid.

PIPING MATERIALS A.149 Design codes using allowable design stresses based on creep properties of the metals, by the nature of the long-term rupture tests involved, take these degrading tendencies into account. However, it is not always appreciated that the time-depen- dent properties, such as ultimate tensile strength and yield strength, can be decreased significantly below the starting property level by the same long-term service. This fact would be important to an engineer concerned with designing a high-temperature structure that must tolerate shock loads, such as seismic effects, that can occur near the end-of-life of the component. More on degradation of properties and the mechanisms involved is discussed later in this chapter. METALLIC MATERIALS Metals are divided into two types: ferrous, which includes iron and iron-base alloys; and nonferrous, covering other metals and alloys. Metallurgy deals with the extrac- tion of metals from ores and also with the combining, treating, and processing of metals into useful engineering materials. This section presents the fundamental metallurgical concepts and practices associated with the most common engineering metals, and outlines metallurgical considerations appropriate in the selection process of metals for piping system construction. Ferrous Metals Metallic iron, one of the most common of metals, is very rarely found in nature in its pure form. It occurs in the form of mineral oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4), and as such it comprises about 6 percent of the earth’s crust. The first step in the production of iron and steel is the reduction of the ore with coke and limestone in the blast furnace. In this process, the oxygen is removed from the ore, leaving a mixture of iron and carbon and small amounts of other elements as impurities. Coke is the reducing element and source of heat. The limestone (CaCO3) acts as a fluxing agent which combines with impurities of the ore in the molten state and floats them to the top of the molten metal pool, where they can be removed as slag. The product removed from the blast furnace is called pig iron and is an impure form of iron containing about 4 percent carbon by weight percent. Liquid pig iron cast from the blast furnace is sometimes used directly for metal castings. More often, however, the iron is remelted in a cupola, or furnace, to further refine it and adjust its composition.5 Cast Iron Pig iron that has been remelted is known as cast iron, a term applicable to iron possessing carbon in excess of 2 weight percent. Compared with steel, cast iron is inferior in malleability, strength, toughness, and ductility. On the other hand, cast iron has better fluidity in the molten state and can be cast satisfactorily into compli- cated shapes. It is also less costly than steel. The most important types of cast iron are white and gray cast irons. White cast iron is so known because of the silvery appearance of its fracture surface when broken. In this alloy, the carbon is present in the form of iron carbide (Fe3C), also known as cementite. This carbide is chiefly responsible for the high

A.150 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS hardness, brittleness, and poor machineability characteristic of white cast iron. Chilled iron, a form of white cast iron, is cast against metal chills that cause rapid cooling, promoting the formation of cementite. Consequently, a structure is obtained which possesses high wear- and abrasion-resistance, the principal attribute of the material, but retains white cast iron’s characteristic brittleness. Malleable cast iron is the name given to white cast iron that has been heat- treated to change its cementite into nodules of graphite. The iron becomes more malleable because, in this condition, the carbon as carbide no longer exists continu- ously through the metal matrix. Gray iron is a widely used type of cast iron. In this alloy, the carbon predominantly exists in the form of graphite flakes. The typical appearance of a fracture of this iron is gray since the graphite flakes are exposed. The strength of gray iron depends on the size of the graphite particles and the amount of cementite formed together with the graphite. The strength of the iron increases as the graphite crystal size decreases and the amount of cementite increases. This material is easily machined. A wide range of tensile strengths can be achieved by alloying gray iron with elements, such as nickel, chromium, and molybdenum. Another member of the cast-iron family is so-called ductile iron. It is a high- carbon magnesium-treated product containing graphite in the form of spheroids. Ductile iron is similar to gray cast iron in machineability, but it possesses superior mechanical properties. This alloy is especially suited for pressure castings. By special procedures (casting against the chill) it is possible to obtain a carbide-containing, abrasion-resistant surface with an interior possessing good ductility.5 Steel Steel is defined as an alloy of iron with not more than 2.0 weight percent carbon. The most common method of producing steel is to refine pig iron by oxidation of impurities and excess carbon, which have a greater affinity for oxygen than iron. The principal reduction methods used are the basic oxygen process (BOP) and the electric furnace process, each representing a type of furnace in which the refining takes place. The BOP primarily uses molten pig iron as the initial furnace charge; the electric furnace can use a charge of selected steel scrap. Another process, called the basic open-hearth process, is no longer in use in the United States. Although it constituted the major steel producing process for decades, it has succumbed to the more advanced and economical BOP and electric furnaces.6 The pig iron is reduced to the desired steel composition through use of acid and/or basic reactions with fluxing agents, heat, oxygen, and time. Excess carbon is oxidized and lost as gas; impurities float to the surface. Often desired alloying elements are added to the molten pool. The steel can be further refined by using one of various methods of vacuum degassing. As the name suggests, the molten steel is passed through a vacuum chamber with the purpose of removing entrained gases such as oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. This operation is performed when extra steel purity is desired, and it results in improved and more uniform properties in the final product form. The molten steel is then cast into molded ingots, which are then further reduced by hot working in rolling and drawing operations. Alternately, the molten steel may be directly cast into continuous smaller billet or hollow products. The latter process is called continuous casting and has become the preferred method of making steel since it avoids the costly ingot reduction operations. Alloying additions are made, if required, to the molten steel either while in the

PIPING MATERIALS A.151 reducing furnace as already noted, in the ladle into which the steel is put, or in the ingot into which steel is poured from the ladle. While the steel is molten in the furnace, oxygen is forcibly injected into it to refine the charge. The oxygen combines with excess carbon and is released as a gas. Excess oxygen is, however, unavoidably left in the molten steel. This results in the formation of oxide inclusions in the steel, or porosity, which appear upon solidification. The process of removing the oxygen is known as deoxidizing practice. Deoxidation is achieved by adding silicon, aluminum, or other deoxidizing agents to the molten steel, the amount of which determines the degree of deoxidation and the type of steel seated. The common names given to these various steel types are killed steel, semikilled steel, and rimmed steel. Steel of the killed type is deoxidized almost completely; that is, sufficient deoxi- dizing agent is added to the molten pool to combine with all the excess entrained oxygen. The result is a large number of tiny oxides in the melt. The lack of gas in the molten pool gives the effect of ‘‘killing’’ any visible bubbling activity of the steel, thus the name. Killed steel has a more uniform composition than any of the other types, and usually possesses the best formability at room temperature. A fine- grained structure results from this practice because the many oxides formed act as initiation sites of new grains upon solidification and subsequent recrystallization. This fine-grained character offers toughness superior to the other types of steel. Rimmed steel employs no purposeful addition of deoxidizing agents, and is characterized by relatively violent bubbling and stirring action in the ingot mold. This type exhibits a marked variation in composition across and from top to bottom of the ingot. The outer rim or outer edge of the solidified ingot is relatively pure and ductile material. The amounts of carbon, phosphorous, sulfur, and nonmetallic inclusions in this rim are lower than the average composition of the whole ingot. The amount of these constituents in the inner portion or core is higher than the ingot average. This type of steel costs less to make than the other types and is widely used for structural applications, where good surface appearance of the final product is desired. Semikilled steel is only partially deoxidized with silicon, aluminum, or both, taking advantage of the positive attributes of killed and rimmed steel. After casting, or teaming into the ingot molds, the steel is normally further reduced in size and modified in shape by mechanical working. The majority of the reduction process is done hot. During hot working, sufficient heat is maintained to ameliorate the working effects and maintain a structure that is relatively soft and ductile throughout the reduction process. The steel in the form of ingot, slab, bar, or billet is first brought to the proper temperature throughout and is then passed through rolls or dies. The flow of metal is continuous and preferentially in one (longitudinal) direction. The cross-sectional area is reduced, and the metal is shaped the desired form. The internal structure of the steel is also favorably affected. The working reduces the grain size of the material, and tends to homogenize the overall structure, compared with cast or unworked steel. Processes used to manufacture pipe and tube are addressed in another chapter. PHYSICAL METALLURGY OF STEEL Like all other metals, iron and steel are crystalline in structure, composed of atoms in a fixed lattice. As noted earlier, iron may exist in one of two cubic forms, body- centered (BCC) or face-centered (FCC).

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.152 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS At room temperature, pure iron is composed of a body-centered cubic lattice. In this form it is known as alpha iron, also called ferrite, which is soft, ductile, and magnetic. When heated above about 1415�F (768�C), alpha iron loses its magnetism but retains its body-centered crystalline structure. This temperature is called the Fermi temperature. The crystal structure changes to face-centered cubic at about 1670�F (910�C), at which temperature alpha iron is transformed to gamma iron, the FCC form, and remains nonmagnetic. As temperature rises further, another phase change occurs at 2570�F (1410�C), when delta iron is formed. This phase is again body-centered like that of the low-temperature alpha iron. It is stable to the melting temperature. In cooling very slowly from the liquid state, the phases reap- pear in reverse order. The solid-state transformations of atomic structure, which occur in pure iron during heating to and cooling from the melting point, are called allotropic changes. The temperatures at which these changes take place are known as transformation or critical temperatures. When carbon is added to iron and steel is produced, the same changes in phase occur, but a more complex relationship with temperature occurs. The effects of varying amounts of carbon content in iron on phase stability as temperature varies is represented in Fig. A3.18. This diagram is called an equilibrium phase diagram, and in this case is the very familiar iron-carbon (Fe-C) phase diagram. With this diagram, one can determine which stable phase the steel will assume at a given composition and temperature. Likewise, the effect of increasing or decreas- ing the amount of carbon content in iron on these critical temperatures can be pre- dicted. Phase diagrams are plotted in weight or atomic percent (horizontal axis) versus temperature (vertical axis). A single-phase region usually represents an area of high concentration of a single element, or an intermetallic single phase stable over a range of composition and temperature. Between these single-phase regions are regions where multiple phases coexist, in relative amounts at any given temperature approximated by the proximity of the specific composition to the single-phase regions. On the Fe-C diagram, single-phase regions are represented by those marked as alpha, gamma, and delta, and Fe3C or cementite, which is a stable intermetal- lic phase. The critical transformation temperatures in steel are the A1, corresponding to about 1335�F (724�C), and A3 referred to as the lower and upper critical temperatures of steel. The A3 constitutes the boundary with the gamma phase, and its temperature varies with carbon content. The lower critical temperature, on the other hand, stays constant over the entire range of steel compositions. These critical temperatures, as well as the entire phase diagram, represent trans- formations that occur under controlled, very slow cooling and heating (i.e., equilib- rium) conditions. More rapid heating and cooling rates, like those encountered in normal steel processing, change these critical temperatures upward and downward, respectively. Additions of other alloying elements also will shift the critical transfor- mation points. It is the effective use by the metallurgist of the knowledge contained on this and similar phase diagrams that allows for the manipulation of properties of engineering materials by varying their chemistry and heat treatment. For steel, the principal phases and their properties are briefly summarized in the following list: Austenite: A single-phase solid solution of carbon in gamma iron (FCC). It exists in ordinary steels only at elevated temperatures, but it is also found at room temperatures, but it is also found at room temperature in certain stainless steels

Cementite: Iron carbide, Fe3C, a compound containing 6.67 percent carbon, which is very hard and extremely brittle. Cementite appears as part of most steel structures, the form of which depends on the specifics of the heat treatment which the steel has received (see pearlite). Pearlite: A mixture of alternating plates of iron carbide (cementite) and ferrite (lamellar structure), which form on slow cooling from within the gamma range.

A.154 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS This condition generally represents a good blend of strength, ductility, and fair machineability. It is the equilibrium structure in steel. Bainite: A mixture of ferrite and cementite, which is harder and stronger than pearlite. It forms by the transformation of austenite in many steels during fairly rapid cooling, but not fast enought to cause martensite formation. The structure consists of ferrite and iron carbide, but unlike pearlite, the aggregate is nonla- mellar. Martensite: The hardest constituent achievable by heat-treating of steels, it is formed by the rapid cooling of austenite to a temperature below the martensite start or Ms temperature. Martensite consists of a distorted cubic unit cell (body- FIGURE A3.19 Isotherm transformation diagrams for AISI 1050 (a) and AISI 4340 (b). (From I-T Diagrams, United States Steel, 1963.)

PIPING MATERIALS A.155 centered tetragonal) which contains substantial quantities of carbon in interstitial solution in the lattice. The Ms temperature varies with steel composition. These latter two microstructural constituents, bainite and martensite, will not be found on the Fe-C phase diagram because they are the direct result of cooling steel at an accelerated rate, which prevents atomic diffusion required to maintain equilibrium conditions. The effects of nonequilibrium cooling of a steel are represented on an isothermal transformation diagram, or a time-temperature transformation (T-T-T) diagram. An example of each is shown in Fig. A3.19. The horizontal axis of the diagram is time, usually log scale; the vertical axis is temperature. A single diagram represents a given steel alloy composition and depicts the various equilibrium and nonequilib- rium phases that will be formed, and their mix, with a given cooling rate from a starting temperature in the austenitic phase region. The diagram is used by entering it at the alloys temperature at time �0, represented as a point of the vertical axis. The cooling rate describes the time/temperature path taken by the material from the starting point, through the field of transformation phases, to the final point of sample cooling. The metallurgical phases or constituents in the final state can thus be predicted. The continuous path followed between the two points also has a bearing on final microstructure. The T-T-T diagram is similar to the equilibrium phase diagram in that single and multiple phase fields are depicted. However, it differs from the equilibrium diagram in that it is a dynamic representation of phase formation with time. Thus quickly cooling to a given temperature above the Ms will result, for example, in coexistence of austenite, ferrite and, cementite (A, F, and C on the figure). However, as time progresses at that temperature, the austenite continues to decompose into more ferrite and cementite, until complete transforma- tion is achieved. Cooling to below the Ms temperature causes tranformation to martensite. If the path of cooling had intersected the ‘‘nose’’ of the T-T-T curve, some ferrite will form and be combined with the martensite in the final microstruc- ture, since martensite can only be formed by quenching austenite. The ferrite that formed on cooling is stable and unaffected by further cooling. ALLOYING OF STEEL The alloying of carbon steel with other elements to obtain a wide range of desired properties is a mature science. The following summarizes the known effects of adding certain elements to steel7: Carbon: In general, increasing the carbon content of steel alloys produces higher ultimate strength and hardness but may lower ductility and toughness. Carbon also increases air-hardening tendencies and weld hardness. In low-alloy steel for high-temperature applications, the carbon content is usually restricted to a maximum of about 0.15 percent in order to assure optimum ductility for welding, expanding, and bending operations. An increasing carbon content lessens the thermal and electrical conductivities of steel. Phosphorus: High phosphorus content has an undesirable effect on the proper- ties of carbon steel, notably on shock resistance and ductility (see the section on temper embrittlement). Phosphorus is effective, however, in improving ma- chineability. In steels, it is normally controlled to less than 0.04 weight percent. Silicon: Used as a deoxidizing agent, silicon increases the tensile strength of

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.156 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS steel without increasing brittleness when limited to less than about 2 percent. Silicon increases resistance to oxidation, increases electrical resistivity, and de- creases hysteresis losses. Thus it is used for electrical applications. Adding silicon may reduce creep rupture strength. Manganese: Manganese is normally present in all commercial steels. The manga- nese combines with sulfur, thus improving hot-working characteristics. In alloy steels, manganese decreases the critical cooling rate to cause a hardened or martensitic structure and thus contributes to deep-hardening. Nickel: As an alloying element in alloy steels, nickel is a ferrite strengthener and toughener and is soluble in all proportions. Nickel steels are easily hardened because nickel lowers the critical cooling rate necessary to produce hardening on quenching. In heat-treated steel, nickel increases the strength and toughness. In combination with chromium, nickel produces alloy steels possessing higher impact and fatigue resistance than can be obtained with straight carbon steels. Chromium: As an alloying element in steel, chromium is miscible in iron as a solid solution, and forms a complex series of carbide compounds. Chromium is essentially a hardening element and is frequently used with a toughening element such as nickel to produce superior mechanical properties. At higher tempera- tures, chromium contributes increased strength and is ordinarily used in conjunc- tion with molydenum. Additions of chromium significantly improve the elevated temperature oxidation resistance of steels. Molybdenum: In steel, molybdenum can form a solid solution with the iron and, depending on the molybdenum and carbon content, can also form a carbide. A deeper hardening steel results. The molybdenum carbide is very stable and is responsible for matrix strengthening in long-term creep service. Vanadium: This element is one of the strong carbide formers. It dissolves to some degree in ferrite, imparting strength and toughness. Vanadium steels show a much finer grain structure than steels of a similar composition without vanadium. Boron: Boron is usually added to steel to improve hardenability; that is, to increase the depth of hardening during quenching. Aluminum: Aluminum is widely used as a deoxidizer in molten steel and for controlling grain size. When added to steel in controlled amounts, it produces a fine grain size. Sulfur: Present to some degree in all steel (less than 0.04 weight percent), sulfur forms a nonmetallic inpurity that, in large amounts, results in cracking during forming at high temperatures (hot shortness). Combining it with managanese forms a MnS compound that is relatively harmless. Copper: Copper dissolves in steel and strengthens the iron as a substitutional element. The use of copper in certain alloys increases resistance to atmospheric corrosion and increases yield strength. However, excessive amounts of copper (usually above 0.3 percent are harmful to elevated temperature performance since the lower melting point element segregates to grain boundaries and locally melts (liquates), causing intergranular separation under applied stress. In general, when used in combination, alloying elements may complement each other and give greater overall benefits than when used singly in much larger quan- tities.

PIPING MATERIALS A.157 CLASSIFICATION OF STEELS There are literally hundreds of wrought grades of steel that range in composition with the variation of the many major and minor alloying elements. The simplest of these classes is known as plain carbon steel, with carbon varying between approxi- mately 0.05 and 1.0 weight percent. Within this broad range fall three general groups according to carbon content; they are defined as follows: 1. Low carbon steels—0.05 to 0.25 percent carbon 2. Medium carbon steels—0.25 to 0.50 percent carbon 3. High carbon steels—0.50 percent and greater carbon content Alloy steels are generally considered to be steels to which one or more alloying elements, other than carbon, have been added to give them special properties that are different than those of straight carbon steels. From the standpoint of composi- tion, steel is considered to be an alloy steel when amounts of manganese, silicon, or copper exceed the maximum limits for the carbon steels, or when purposeful addition of minimum quantities of other alloying elements are added. These could be chromium, molybdenum, nickel, copper, cobalt, niobium, vanadium, or others. The next higher class of alloyed steel useful to the piping industry is ferritic and martensitic stainless steels. These are steels alloyed with chromium contents above about 12 percent. Because of the chromium, these materials possess good corrosion resistance. They retain a ferritic (BCC) crystal structure, allowing the grades to be hardened by heat treatment. When sufficient nickel is added to iron-chromium alloys, an austenitic (FCC) structure is retained at room temperature. Austenitic stainless steels possess an excellent combination of strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance. These steels cannot be hardened by quenching, since the austenite does not transform to mar- tensite. A stronger type of stainless steel has been developed which takes advantage of precipitation reactions within the metal matrix made possible by addition of ele- ments such as aluminum, titanium, copper, and nitrogen. These materials are re- ferred to as precipitation—hardenable stainless steels. Both martensitic and austen- itic stainless steels can be enhanced in this manner. As annealed, these materials are soft and readily formed. When fully hardened, through aging heat treatments, they attain their full strength potential. STEEL HEAT-TREATING PRACTICES Various heat treatments can be used to manipulate specific properties of steel, such as hardness and ductility, to improve machinability, to remove internal stresses, or to obtain high strength levels and impact properties. The heat treatments of steel commonly employed—annealing, normalizing, spheroidizing, hardening (quench- ing), and tempering—are briefly described in the following paragraphs.8 Annealing Several types of annealing processes are used on carbon and low-alloy steel. These are generally referred to as full annealing, process annealing, and spheroidizing an- nealing.

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.158 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS In full annealing, the steel is heated to just above the upper critical (A3) tempera- ture, held for a sufficient length of time to fully austenitize the material structure, and then allowed to cool at a slow, controlled rate in the furnace. The microstructure of fully annealed low-carbon steel consists of ferrite and pearlite. A full anneal provides a relatively soft, ductile material, free of internal stresses. Process annealing sometimes referred to as stress-relieving, is carried out at temperatures below the lower critical (A1) temperature. This treatment is used to improve the ductility and decrease residual stresses in work-hardened steel. The usual purpose of spheroidizing is to soften the steel and improve its machin- ability. Heating steel that possesses a pearlite microstructure for a long time at just below the lower critical temperature, followed by very slow cooling, will cause spheroidization. This is an agglomeration of the iron carbide, which eventually assumes a spheroidal shape. The properties of this product normally represent the softest condition that can be achieved in the grade of steel being heat-treated. The austenitic stainless steels are annealed differently from carbon steels. First, since they posses a fully austenitic structure, the temperature used is not related to a critical transformation temperature. Rather, the intent of the annealing is to remove residual strain in the lattice, recrystallize the metal grains, and to dissolve any iron and chromium carbides that may exist in the matrix material. The temperature selected is usually at or above 1900�F (1038�C). Second, the cooling rate from the annealing temperature is normally as rapid as possible. This suppresses the reformation of carbides at the austenitic grain boundaries during cooling. Formation of grain boundary carbides results in local depletion of chromium in the matrix in the vicinity of the carbides, rendering this thin band of material susceptable to attack in a number of corrosive media. This susceptible condition is referred to as sensitization, and the resultant corrosion is termed intergranular attack. The temperature range in which carbides are most apt to form in austenitic stainless steels is between about 850 and 1500�F (454 and 816�C). Slow cooling through or holding in this zone will sensitize the steel. The degree of sensitization that will occur can be greatly reduced by adding small amounts of elements that possess a stronger tendency to form carbides than the chromium. Two such elements, niobium and titanium, are added to form the so-called stabilized austenitic stainless steels. Alternately, the carbon content can be held as low as possible, thereby resulting in as few carbides as possible. These are termed the L grade stainless steels. Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels will also be adversely affected by slow cooling from annealing temperatures. When slow cooled, or held in the temperature range of 750 to 950�F (400 to 510�C), these materials embrittle (see discussion on ‘‘474�C’’ embrittlement). Normalizing This carbon and low-alloy steel heat treatment is similar to the annealing process, except that the steel is allowed to cool in air from temperatures above the upper critical temperature. Normalizing relieves the internal stresses caused by previous working. While it produces sufficient softness and ductility for many purposes, it leaves the steel harder and with higher tensile strength than after annealing. Normalizing is often followed by tempering. Hardening (Quenching) When steels of the higher-carbon grades are heated to produce austenite and then cooled rapidly (quenched), the austenite transforms into martensite. Martensite is

PIPING MATERIALS A.159 formed at temperatures usually below about 400�F (204�C), depending on the carbon content and the type and amount of alloying steel. It is the hardest form of heat- treated steel and has high strength and resistance to abrasion. Martensitic steels have poor impact strength and are difficult to machine. Tempering Tempering is a secondary heat treatment performed on some normalized and almost all hardened steel structures. The object of tempering is to remove some of the brittleness by allowing certain solid-state transformations to occur. It involves heat- ing to a predetermined level, always below the lower critical temperature, followed by a controlled rate of cooling. In most cases tempering reduces the hardness of the steel, increases its toughness, and eliminates residual stresses. The higher the tempering temperature used for a given time, the more pronounced is the property change. Some steels may become embrittled on slowly cooling from certain temper- ing temperatures. Steels so affected are said to be temper-brittle. To overcome this difficulty, steels of that type are cooled rapidly from the tempering temperature. Temper embrittlement is covered elsewhere in this chapter. DEGRADATION OF MATERIALS IN SERVICE A number of metallurgically based processes can occur in steels which contribute to loss of engineering strength, and even premature failure. Several of these are addressed in the following paragraphs. Aging of Properties A number of steels that have accumulated considerable service time are known to have experienced changes in their properties, usually to their detriment. This phenomenon has been called aging, and occurs in materials that are heat-treated or cold-worked to achieve high strength levels and to be used at elevated temperatures. These materials are potentially more susceptible to failure after the condition has developed. ‘‘Aging’’ in this case should not be confused with the same term used to represent the purposeful heat treatment performed to some types of nonferrous alloys. In the context being addressed here, aging refers to that normally very slowly progressing metallurgical reaction that occurs in a number of alloys while at operating tempera- tures for extended periods of time. Some specific types of this behavior (i.e., temper embrittlement and ‘‘885’’ embrittlement) are addressed in the paragraphs that follow. Components that experience considerable service time contain materials that have aged with time. The materials of special interest are those that regularly experience higher operating temperatures; for example, ferritic steels above 900�F (482�C) and austenitic stainless steels at or above 1000�F (538�C). A study sponsored by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code attempted to identify and quantify these effects. The effort was the result of concerns for near end-of-life seismic loadings in elevated-temperature nuclear boilers. Data gathered from a number of sources have shown that the room and elevated temperature yield strengths of both ferritic and austenitic steels may degrade after

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.160 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS long exposure times. Ultimate tensile strength is affected, but to a lesser degree. The yield strength reductions can amount to as much as 40 percent in ferritic and 20 percent in austenitic steels. Creep tests have also been run after long-term (e.g., 10,000 h) static exposure to elevated temperatures. No substantial negative effect on creep properties were noted in these tests. In the case of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and ASME B31.1 Power Piping Code design and construction, the degradation of yield strength does not generally violate or invalidate the conservatism built into their design rules, as manifest by the allowable design stresses. For example, in Section 1 of the ASME Boiler Code, addressing design and construction of power boilers, the material design allowable stresses for wrought materials are established by applying the following factors to base material properties. The lowest calculated value of all the following is assumed as the design allowable stress at a given temperature: ●¹⁄₄ specified minimum tensile strength at room temperature ●²⁄₃ specified minimum yield strength at room temperature ●¹⁄₄ tensile strength at the temperature of interest above room temperature ●²⁄₃ yield strength at the temperature of interest above room temperature ●67 percent of the average stress to cause rupture in 100,000 h ●80 percent of the minimum stress to cause rupture in 100,000 h ●100 percent of the stress to produce 0.01 percent strain in 1000 h In this manner, short-term properties, stress rupture strength, and creep rate are all taken into account. Typically, at the lower end of the temperature use range, the factored tensile and yield strength controls, and at higher temperatures, the creep properties set the allowable stresses. Since most aging occurs at the higher temperatures, tensile and yield strength degradation does not normally cause concern. However, if large shock loads can occur late in component life (as is possible under seismic conditions), these short- term, time-independent properties can be critical to the components’ continued safe operation. As an illustration of the effect reduced yield strength has on fatigue, consider that with a lower yield strength, more plastic strain will result from a given high thermal, or mechanically induced stress. Since these stresses are usually due to operational transients, stress reversals can occur during continued operation (i.e., temperature stabilization at steady state, or ultimately, component shutdown). The greater the plastic strain cycle, the greater the damage, and the sooner the failure. It is clear that as components experience increasing service time, they become less resilient to significant operational transients. That is, materials are less likely to withstand these transients than earlier in their life, not only because more cycles have continued to accumulate (toward an end-of-life limit), but also because material strength properties are degrading with time. Temper Embrittlement Temper embrittlement is a phenomenon that occurs in carbon and alloy steels when aged in the temperature range roughly between 660 and 1020�F (350 and 550�C). The property most significantly affected is toughness. The time in which this occurs is a function of the steel’s chemical composition, heat treatment condition, fabrication

PIPING MATERIALS A.161 history, and service temperature. The most severe degradation occurs in weld regions. Due to the extensive use of Cr–Mo steels in the petrochemical and power boiler industries, most of the studies have concentrated on this family of materials. It has been recognized for some years that a steel’s susceptibility to temper embrittlement is due to the existence and amount of the trace elements antimony (Sb), phosphorous (P), tin (Sn), and arsenic (As), with P and Sn having the greatest effect. Other elements that may contribute to reduced toughness are silicon, manga- nese, and copper. Beneficial effects can be gained by additions of molydbenum and aluminum. The obvious dependency of temper embrittlement severity and chemistry has led to the development of a number of embrittlement factors.9 Bruscato made the first attempt to combine the effects of various elements into a single factor, known as the embrittlement factor X, which is expressed as follows: The concentration of elements is in parts per million (ppm). Miyano and Adachi arrived at a J-factor defined as: Finally, Katsumata et al, asserted that the following embrittlement factor (E.F.) was appropriate for 2¹⁄₄ Cr–1Mo and 3 Cr–1Mo steels. Y = 1 100(10P + 5Sn + Sb + As) (in ppm) All of these are useful in assessing the relative susceptibility of various steel compositions to temper embrittlement. In all cases, the larger the factor, the more susceptible the particular heat of steel is to embrittlement. The type of heat treatment applied to the materials may also affect a material’s susceptibility to temper embrittle. For example, a number of experimenters have confirmed that 2¹⁄₄ Cr–1 Mo alloy steels’ susceptibility increases as austenitizing temperature used during its heat treatment increases. Inversely, susceptibility is lowest after an intercritical hold, at a temperature between the lower and upper critical temperature (Ac1 and Ac3, respectively). This effect is believed to be associ- ated with the grain size achieved during the hold time, a larger grain being more detrimental. Although intercritically treated materials are less susceptible to temper embrittlement, they are weaker in the as-heat-treated condition. In a parallel fashion, the degree of embrittlement, as measured by loss of tough- ness or shift of nil ductility temperature, is decreased if the material is more substan- tially tempered prior to the embrittling treatment. In this context, ‘‘tempered’’ represents the planned heat treatment that typically follows a normalizing or austeni- tizing and rapid quenching operation. A longer or higher temperature temper results in a softer, less strong, and more ductile condition, usually accompanied by good fracture toughness. Luckily, the temper embrittled condition is reversible. Heat treatment for short periods of time at temperatures well above the upper critical will result in reestablish- ing nearly virgin properties in these materials.

A.162 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Hydrogen Attack Hydrogen attack is one of the most important problems with materials used in ammonia synthesis, oil refining, and coal gasification equipment.9 The first major failure of an ammonia convertor attributable to hydrogen damage was in 1933. Since then more failures and untold damage to materials have accumu- lated, with the majority of damage occurring in the welds or weld heat-affected zones of these components. When carbon and low-alloy steels are held in hydrogen at high temperature and pressure for an extended period of time, these materials can suffer degrading effects to their tensile and creep rupture properties. This is accompanied by the formation of intergranular fissures, blisters on the surface, and loss of carbon content (decarbur- ization). The phenomenon is called hydrogen attack and is generally attributed to the formation of methane (CH4) within the steel. The microstructural damage occurs when methane bubbles form and grow around precipitates at the grain boundaries within the material. The continued growth of the bubbles causes grains to separate along their boundaries and the bubbles, or voids, to coalesce. The rate of growth of the bubbles is a function of the ease by which the steel carbides give up carbon atoms to the intruding hydrogen atoms to form the methane. The more stable the carbide, the slower this reaction will take place. Thus, it has been long recognized that additions of chromium and molybdenum, both strong carbide stablizers, improves hydrogen-attack resistance of steels. Addition of other carbide-stabilizing elements such as titanium and tung- sten has also assisted in reducing susceptibility. Weld regions are more susceptible to hydrogen damage because they possess less stable carbides. It is also readily apparent that carbon content of the base material is an important variable in determining the susceptibility of a steel to hydrogen damage. In general, steels used in this service are kept below 0.20 weight percent carbon content. Certain other elements, such as nickel and copper, are known to also have a detrimental effect. Nelson curves have proven indispensable in the selection of materials in hydrogen service. These curves (see Fig. A3.20. for an example) were originally based on experience gathered over several decades, and have been revised as new experience has been gained. These curves identify a ‘‘safe’’ regime in which an alloy will perform acceptably at various temperatures and hydrogen partial pressures. Where these curves have proven unconservative have been associated with weld heat- affected zones that had been inadequately postweld heat-treated (PWHT). The high residual stresses and high hardness left in the weld region contribute to accelerated damage. For this reason, most specifications for hydrogen service equipment stipu- late a maximum hardness in weld regions that will assure adequacy of the PWHT. The limit is usually placed at 210 Brinell hardness, corresponding approximately to a 100,000 psi (690 Ma) ultimate tensile strength. Austenitic stainless steels are essentially immune to hydrogen damage. The numerous sites within the FCC lattice in which the hydrogen atoms can be safely accommodated, and the inherent ductility of the lattice, gives austenitic materials this freedom from hydrogen damage. However, when stainless overlay weld metal has been used over carbon or low-alloy vessel steels, hydrogen-induced cracking can occur at the weld fusion line just inside the ferritic material. ‘‘885�F’’ (474�C) Embrittlement One of the limitations of ferritic stainless steels (those alloys of iron possessing greater than about 14 pecent chromium) has been the loss of toughness at room

This is commonly referred to as 885�F (474�C) embrittlement, corresponding approximately to the temperature at which many of the alloys degrade the fastest. The compositional effects in commercial alloys on 885�F (474�C) embrittlement have not been systematically investigated. However, it is clear that the degree of embrittlement increases as chromium content increases. The effects that other elements may have is not clear. Of these, most important is carbon, and it has been reported as having from no effect to a retarding effect on embrittlement. This phenomenon results in increased hardness and strength, with a correspond- ing decrease in ductility, fracture toughness, and a decrease in corrosion resistance. Loss of toughness can be particularly severe, and in fact has tended to relegate the use of this class of alloy to temperature regimes below which significant embrittle- ment can occur. Graphitization Graphitization is a time- and temperature-dependent nucleation and growth process, in which iron carbide in the form of pearlite first spheroidizes, and later forms graphite nodules. There are two general types:

A.164 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS 1. Formation of randomly, relatively uniformly distributed graphite nodules in the steel. This reduces the room temperature mechanical strength somewhat, but does not affect the creep-rupture strength at elevated temperature. 2. A concentrated formation of graphite most frequently along the edges of the heat-affected zone of weldments. This is referred to as chain graphite, since a plane of nodules exists paralleling the weld bead contours. The formation of these nodules, when aligned through the wall of a pressure part, creates planes of weakness, subject to rupture. Fracture characteristically occurs without prior warning. The first graphitization failure of a low-carbon steam piping material occurred in the early 1940s. The failure occurred after five and a half years of service in a steam line made of aluminum-killed carbon-molydenum steel. The fracture surface was located approximately ¹⁄₁₆ in (1.6 mm) from the fusion zone of a butt weld. The failure precipitated numerous and extensive research programs to understand the key variables of the mechanism and to determine the steels which would re- sist graphitization. Research has helped in the understanding of the problem, and led to restrictions adopted by the various design codes on use of materials subject to graphitization. Carbon steel and carbon-molybdenum grades are the most susceptible to this degra- dation process, with the latter being more so. Relative susceptibility of these two grades is also dependent on the steel’s aluminum content; the more aluminum, the greater the susceptibility. Additions of chromium in amounts as low as 0.5 weight percent make the steel essentially immune to graphitization. The ASME Code permits the use of carbon and carbon-molybdenum steels in ASME Section 1 boiler applications up to 1000�F (538�C). A cautionary note is provided in the allowable stress tables of Section I indicating the carbon steels and carbon-molybdenum steels may be susceptible to graphitization at temperatures above about 800 and 875�F (427 to 468�C), respectively. ASME B31.1 has a similar precautionary note specifying limits of 775 and 850�F (413 and 454�C), respectively. Graphitization is a mechanism dependent on diffusion and is not associated with a precise temperature of initiation (it occurs sooner at higher temperatures). Thus, the differences between the design codes only reflect different levels of conservatism in dealing with the failure mode. Many manufacturers extend even more severe restrictions, some prohibiting the use of these steels in piping applications outside the boiler or pressure vessel where rupture creates a serious safety hazard. Substitu- tion of chromium-containing steel grades, such as SA.335 P2(¹⁄₂Cr-¹⁄₂Mo), P11 (1¹⁄₄Cr-¹⁄₂Mo), and P22 (2¹⁄₄Cr-1Mo), is normally recommended for these applica- tions. Grade P91 (9Cr-1Mo-V) is increasingly being used in high-temperature appli- cations where use of P11 and P22 is not desirable due to their reduced mechani- cal strength. Intergranular Attack When an unstabilized austenitic stainless steel is held at a temperature within the range of 850 to 1500�F (454 to 816�C), chromium carbides will quickly and preferentially form at the austenitic grain boundaries. The formation of these car- bides deletes the surrounding grain matrix of chromium atoms, rendering the thin zone adjacent to grain boundary susceptible to corrosive attack in aqueous environ- ments. This condition is called sensitization, and the resulting corrosion is termed intergranular attack (IGA). When also in the presence of local high-tension stresses, the result can be intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC). Avoidance of

*Source: piping-handbook*

PIPING MATERIALS A.165 these failure mechanisms is best achieved by minimizing sensitization (fast cool from anneal; stabilized or L-grade steels), and eliminating local stresses. The area of piping components most often attacked is weld regions. Sensitization can readily occur in a narrow band of base material in the heat-affected zone, caused by the heat of the weld pool. Corrosion of this area has been called knife line attack due to the characteristic appearance of a thin crack along a weld edge. Sigmatization A hard, brittle, nonmagnetic phase will form in some Fe-Cr and Fe-Ni-Cr alloys upon prolonged exposure to temperatures between about 1100 and 1475�F (593 and 800�C). Those austentic stainless steels containing higher alloy content, such as type 310 (25% Cr–20% Ni) are susceptible, as well as any grades that possess residual ferrite in their microstructure, a constituent which will transform to sigma, preferentially at grain boundaries. The most deterimental effect of sigma is reduction of toughness. Charpy V- notch impact toughness can degrade to less than 10 ft · lb (14 joules) at room temperature if as much as 10 percent of the volume of material transforms. Tough- ness is usually not significantly degraded at higher temperatures, above about 1000�F (538�C). Chemically, sigma is not as resistant to oxidizing media as the austenite, such as acidic environments, thus, the materials will undergo intergranular attack. At normal metal operating temperatures in power plants, sigmatization of pres- sure piping made of these high-alloy materials takes very long times to form. Once formed, the phase can be redissolved by subjecting the material to an annealing heat treatment. Creep Damage and Estimation of Remaining Creep Life The type of damage observed in components operating at high temperatures, and high stress, typically progresses in stages occurring over a considerable period of time. Elongation or swelling of the component may be observed. Material damage manifests itself in the microstructure in characteristic form at grain boundaries. Voids will form first, which then subsequently link up to form cracks. These cracks increase in size or severity as the end-of-life condition is approached. Severe- damage indications invariably signal the need for near-term corrective action. Such corrective action may entail repair or replacement of the component in question, depending upon the extent of the damage and the feasibility of repair. It is important to note that, except in the most severe cases, damage is not readily detectable by the naked eye, or even by conventional nondestructive techniques such as ultrasonic, magnetic particle, or liquid penetrant examination methods. The degree of microstructural damage can be assessed by conventional metallo- graphic procedures that may either take a destructive sampling approach or use nondestructive in-place (in-situ) methods. Since the determination of the structural damage allows for a ready estimation of expended creep-rupture life, these inspec- tion methods have recently been adopted to piping and other structural components. The power piping industry, in particular, has seen a wholesale application of metallo- graphic examination to components that have experienced extensive time in ele- vated temperature service. Several serious steam line ruptures have caused deaths, serious injury, and significant lost operating time at fossil energy power plants. The

A.166 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS steam lines that have come under the greatest scrutiny are reheat superheater piping which, based on their relatively large diameters and thin walls, had been made from rolled and welded plate. The failures have been associated with the longitudinal weld regions, which are inherently more susceptible to problems due to danger of latent defects (lack of fusion, slag entrapment, solidification cracks), and the variabil- ity in mechanical properties across the welds heat-affected zone. Destructive sampling of material surfaces of suspected creep-damaged compo- nents, to allow for metallographic examination, has evolved to the point where there can be minimal disturbance to surrounding material. Test samples are either trepanned through thickness or smaller silver (boat-shaped) samples are removed by sawing, electro discharge machining, or other methods. However, arc gouging or any other form of heat-producing mechanism must be avoided. It not only can significantly metallurgically alter surrounding material but also can damage the destructive sample, sometimes rendering it unusable for microscopic analysis. The small samples, once properly removed, are metallographically prepared in the stan- dard fashion. These are then examined at high magnification in metallurgical micro- scopes for evidence of creep damage. The area from which this sample was removed must be weld repaired, employing the required preheat, postweld heat treatment, and weld inspections. Alternately, an evaluation of microstructure can be performed in place on the component surface, in the area of interest using a procedure called replication, which provides, in a manner of speaking, a fingerprint image of the surface. The area to be examined is first carefully polished to a mirrorlike finish using ever- increasing fineness of sandpapers or grinding disks, and then polishing compounds. The surface is then etched with an appropriate acid. A thin, softened plastic film is then applied to the surface. Upon drying, the film hardens, retaining the micro- structure in relief. When properly done by skilled technicians, the resolution of the metal structure at magnifications up to 500X or higher is almost equal to that achieved on an actual metal sample. The disadvantage of the replication method is that only the surface of the material can be examined, leaving any subsurface damage undetected. However, this method has proven useful when applied to weld regions, or other high-stressed areas where damage is suspected. Remaining creep-life determination done in this fashion is not exact; the correla- tion between the type and degree of damage, and expended creep life is only approximate. In most cases, follow-up inspection several years hence is necessary to determine the rate of damage progression. Usually, when a network of micro- cracks has been generated, it is time to consider repair or replacement. The science of estimating the expected growth rate of these cracks by creep evolved very rapidly in the 1980s. Armed with sufficient baseline creep data of a given alloy, formulas have been developed that can predict creep crack growth rates reasonably accurately. Analysis can also be made whether a pipeline would ‘‘leak before break’’; that is, weep fluid for a time prior to catastrophic rupture. All of these tools are available to the piping designer and to operating management, but will not be discussed in any greater detail in this chapter. Oxide Thickness and Estimation of Remaining Creep Life Another method for estimating remaining creep life of certain high-temperature tubing and piping components considers the amount of metal oxide scale that has formed on the metals surface. Understandably, this method only applies when the tubular items contain relatively benign substances under oxidizing conditions. It

PIPING MATERIALS A.167 has found its use in steam-carrying piping and components. This method is based on the knowledge that a given thickness of oxide scale on the tube or pipe surface represents growth for a certain time at some temperature. Since oxide growth kinetics of many alloys are well characterized, the effective temperature at which the tube was operating for a known time (service life) can be estimated. The combination of effective temperature and time can then be compared to the typical creep life of the alloy at an applied stress or stresses that are known to have acted on the component during its service life. As noted, the two principal tools needed by the metallurgist to estimate life using the oxide measurement technique are (1) steam oxidation data for the alloy in question, and (2) uniaxial creep-rupture data for that alloy across the temperature range of interest. This latter information can be found for many of the most widely FIGURE A3.21 Variation of Larson-Miller rupture parameter with stress for wrought 1¹⁄₄ Cr ¹⁄₂ Mo-Si steel.

(Supplemental Report on the Elevated-Temperature Properties of Chromium-Molybdenum Steels, ASTM Data Series Publication DS 652.) used ferrous alloy piping materials in ASTM references. The specific steps followed in this approach are as follows: 1. Oxide thickness is measured either metallographically on a sample or using specialized ultrasonic techniques. Operating time is known. 2. The effective operating temperature is determined from the oxidation data. The effective temperature is defined as the constant temperature that the particular tube metal would have had to have operated at for the known service time to have resulted in the measured oxide thickness. (This is an approximation, since the tube or pipe would have operated at various temperatures, perhaps even in upset conditions well above the design temperature limit.) 3. The hoop stress is calculated using an appropriate formula, knowing the tube or pipe size and operating pressure. 4. The Larsen-Miller Parameter (LMP) is calculated for the service time and effec- tive temperature of the subject tube. The LMP is defined as:

*Source: piping-handbook*

PIPING MATERIALS A.169 Where T is temperature in degrees Rankine and t is time in hours. This is a simple factor representing the actual condition of the operating component. 5. Uniaxial creep-rupture data is obtained for the alloy in question. Examples of data for 1¹⁄₄Cr-¹⁄₂Mo-Si and 2¹⁄₄Cr-1Mo, taken from creep data sources ASTM DS50 and DS652 are shown as Fig. A3.21 and Fig. A3.22. This rupture data is normally represented by curves of minimum and average behavior, and lists applied stress versus LMP. 6. The ASTM rupture curve is entered on the stress axis at the level of appropriate calculated operating stress (from step 3). In this manner, the LMP representing the expected minimum and average total creep life at that stress is determined. 7. The operating LMP calculated in step 4 is compared to the LMPs derived in step 6. The differential in time represented by these parameters can be easily calculated from the Larsen-Miller formula, and the percentage of expended life versus minimum and average expected life can be determined by taking a ratio of these values. This method for estimating remaining creep life has found its greatest use in the fossil power boiler industry, particularly for ferritic alloy steam piping and superheater tubing. Since a great majority of the operating power boilers in the United States are approaching their originally intended lifetime, the method is critical for establishing when major repair or replacement is necessary to restore the unit to safer and more reliable operation. MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) have devised a standardized numbering system for the various classes of carbon and alloy steels that has gained widespread acceptance in North America. This system employs a four-digit number for carbon and low-alloy steels, and a three-digit number for stainless steels. Regarding the former, the first two digits represents the major alloying elements of the grade. The final two digits represent the nominal carbon content of each alloy, in hundreds of weight percent. For example, 10XX represents simple carbon steels, and 41XX stands for steels with chromium-molybdenum as the major alloying elements. In both classes, a specific grade possessing a nominal carbon content of 0.20 percent would be, respectively, 1020 and 4120. In this fashion the many possible alloy steels can be systemati- cally identified. Table A3.4 lists the carbon and alloy steel grades categories recognized by AISI and SAE. The stainless steels are assigned a three-digit code by AISI. Those austenitic stainless steels composed of chromium, nickel, and manganese are the 2XX series. Chromium-nickel austenitic stainless steels are 3XX; ferritic and martensitic stain- less steels are 4XX. In the case of stainless steels, the last two digits represent a unique overall composition rather than the level of carbon. Due to increasing international technical community involvement and coopera- tion, and with each country possessing its own alloy numbering system, a worldwide universal system of material identification was needed. The Unified Numbering System (UNS) was the result. In this system a letter is followed by a five-digit

A.174 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS intended purpose. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and the American Petroleum Institute (API) have generated a series of comprehensive material specifications that extend this control. Table A3.5 lists the more common ASME specification and grade numbers for the common piping system materials of construction. Table A3.6 gives equivalencies between selected piping material grades in ASME with the Unified Numbering System (UNS). Copper and Copper Alloys The use of copper and copper alloys is limited to temperatures below the lower recrystallization temperature for the particular alloy. This is the temperature at which cold-worked specimens begin to soften. This recrystallization is usually accom- panied by a marked reduction in tensile strength. Typical classes of wrought copper- based materials are given in Table A3.7. Brasses containing 70 percent or more of copper may be used successfully at temperatures up to 400�F (200�C), while those containing only 60 percent of copper should not be used at temperatures above 300�F (150�C).

The ASME B31 Code for Pressure Piping also limits brass and copper pipe and tubing to this temperature for steam, gas, and air piping. Table A3.8 lists a number of ASME specifications for copper and copper alloy piping and tubing. Nickel and Nickel Alloys Nickel is a tough, malleable metal that offers good resistance to oxidation and corrosion. When nickel is combined with copper as the secondary element, the well-known series of Monel alloys are created. Nickel, Monel, and various modifica- tions of these materials are used in piping systems, turbine blading, valves, and miscellaneous power plant accessories handling steam. The presence of even a small amount of sulfur in a reducing environment will result in embrittlement as temperatures of 700–1200�F (370–650�C).

A.178 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS By addition of Cr, Co, Mo, Ti, Al, or Nb, the high temperature strength and creep resistance of the nickel-base materials can be substantially increased. How- ever, these alloys possess low ductility values and require special care in forming of these materials, even at elevated temperatures. Table A3.9 lists a number of ASME specifications for nickel-based alloy piping and tubing. Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys Aluminum and many of its alloys are highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion and to attack by many chemical agents, with the exception of strong alkalis. However, they are subject to galvanic attack if coupled with more noble materials. Additions of alloying elements increases strengh, but to the detriment of thermal and electrical conductivity, and lowers the material’s melting point. Alloying with Cu, Mg, and Si creates heat-treatable alloys that are age-hardenable. Maximum strength can usually be achieved by heating to about 300 to 500�F (150 to 260�C). Effects of working or precipitation hardening can be removed by annealing at temperatures of 600 to 800�F (315 to 425�C). A system has been devised to designate alloys of aluminum based on the major alloying constituent. See Table A3.10. Typical classes of wrought aluminum-based materials are given in Table A3.11. The UNS number for each alloy is easily determined by taking the alloy number given in Table A3.11 and preceding it with A9. Thus, for example, the UNS numbers for alloy 6061 is A96061. Appendix A5 provides a list of material specifications which are acceptable for design and construction of piping systems within the jurisdiction of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and the ASME B31, Code for Pressure Piping. Appendix A6 lists some international material specifications for piping. REFERENCES 1.

CHAPTER A4 PIPING CODES AND STANDARDS Mohinder L. Nayyar, P.E. ASME Fellow Codes usually set forth requirements for design, materials, fabrication, erection, test, and inspection of piping systems, whereas standards contain design and construction rules and requirements for individual piping components such as elbows, tees, returns, flanges, valves, and other in-line items. Compliance to code is generally mandated by regulations imposed by regulatory and enforcement agencies. At times, the insurance carrier for the facility leaves hardly any choice for the owner but to comply with the requirements of a code or codes to ensure safety of the workers and the general public. Compliance to standards is normally required by the rules of the applicable code or the purchaser’s specification. Each code has limits on its jurisdiction, which are precisely defined in the code. Similarly, the scope of application for each standard is defined in the standard. Therefore, users must become familiar with limits of application of a code or standard before invoking their requirements in design and construction documents of a piping system. The codes and standards which relate to piping systems and piping components are published by various organizations. These organizations have committees made up of representatives from industry associations, manufacturers, professional groups, users, government agencies, insurance companies, and other interest groups. The committees are responsible for maintaining, updating, and revising the codes and standards in view of technological developments, research, experience feedback, problems, and changes in referenced codes, standards, specifications, and regula- tions. The revisions to various codes and standards are published periodically. Therefore, it is important that engineers, designers, and other professional and technical personnel stay informed with the latest editions, addenda, or revisions of the codes and standards affecting their work. While designing a piping system in accordance with a code or a standard, the designer must comply with the most restrictive requirements which apply to any of the piping elements. In regard to applicability of a particular edition, issue, addendum, or revision of a code or standard, one must be aware of the national, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations governing its applicability in addition to the commitments made by the owner and the limitations delineated in the code or standard. This A.179

A.180 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS chapter covers major codes and standards related to piping. Some of these codes and standards are discussed briefly, whereas others are listed for convenience of reference. AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is one of the leading organizations in the world which develops and publishes codes and standards. The ASME established a committee in 1911 to formulate rules for the construction of steam boilers and other pressure vessels. This committee is now known as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee, and it is responsible for the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. In addition, the ASME has established other committees which develop many other codes and standards, such as the ASME B31, Code for Pressure Piping. These committees follow the procedures accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ASME BOILER AND PRESSURE VESSEL CODE The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code contains 11 sections: Section I Power Boilers Section II Material Specifications Section III Rules for Construction of Nuclear Power Plant Components ●Division 1 Nuclear Power Plant Components ●Division 2 Concrete Reactor Vessel and Containments ●Division 3 Containment Systems and Transport Packaging for Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste Section IV Heating Boilers Section V Nondestructive Examination Section VI Recommended Rules for Care and Operation of Heating Boilers Section VII Recommended Rules for Care of Power Boilers Section VIII Pressure Vessels ●Division 1 Pressure Vessels ●Division 2 Pressure Vessels (Alternative Rules) ●Division 3 Alternative Rules for Construction of High-Pressure Vessels Section IX Welding and Brazing Qualifications Section X Fiber-Reinforced Plastic Pressure Vessels Section XI Rules for In-Service Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components Code Cases: Boilers and Pressure Vessels Code Cases: Nuclear Components

PIPING CODES AND STANDARDS A.181 Primarily, Sections, I, II, III, IV, V, VIII, IX, and XI specify rules and requirements for piping. Section II, V, and IX are supplementary sections of the code because they have no jurisdiction of their own unless invoked by reference in the code of record for construction, such as Section I or III. Editions and Addenda Code editions are published every three years and incorporate the additions and revisions made to the code during the preceding three years. Colored-sheet addenda, which include additions and revisions to individual sec- tions of the code, are published annually. Before the 1986 edition of the code, addenda were published semiannually as summer and winter addenda. Interpretations ASME issues written replies to inquiries concerning interpretation of technical aspects of the code. The interpretations for each individual section are published separately as part of the update service to that section. They are issued semiannually up to the publication of the next edition of the code. Interpretations are not part of the code edition or the addenda. Code Cases The Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee meets regularly to consider proposed additions and revisions to the code; to formulate cases to clarify the intent of the existing requirements; and/or to provide, when the need is urgent, rules for materials or construction not covered by existing code rules. The code cases are published in the appropriate code casebook: (1) Boiler and Pressure Vessel and (2) Nuclear Components. Supplements are published and issued to the code holders or buyers up to the publication of the next edition of the code. Code case(s) can be reaffirmed or annulled by the ASME Council. Reaffirmed code case(s) can be used after approval by the council. However, the use of code case(s) is subject to acceptance by the regulatory and enforcement authorities having jurisdiction. A code case once used for construction may continue to be used even if it expires later or becomes annulled. An annulled code case may become a part of the addenda or edition of the code or just disappear after its annulment because there may not be any need for it. ASME SECTION I: POWER BOILERS Scope ASME Section I has total administrative jurisdiction and technical responsibility for boiler proper; refer to Fig. A4.1. The piping defined as boiler external piping (BEP) is required to comply with the mandatory certification by code symbol stamping, ASME data forms, and authorized inspection requirements, called Ad- ministrative Jurisdiction, of ASME Section I; however, it must satisfy the technical

Code addenda are effective on—and may be used on or after—the date of issue. Revisions become mandatory as minimum require- ments six months after such date of issuance, except for boilers (or pressure vessels) contracted for before the end of the six-month period.

PIPING CODES AND STANDARDS A.183 Use of revisions and code cases that are less restrictive than former requirements of the applicable edition and addenda shall not be made without assurance that they have been accepted by the proper authorities in the jurisdiction in which the power boiler (component) is to be installed. Use of code cases is permissible begin- ning with the ASME council approval date published on the code case. ASME SECTION II: MATERIALS Scope ASME Section II consists of four parts, three of which contain material specifications and the fourth the properties of materials which are invoked for construction of items within the scope of the various sections of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and ASME B31, Code for Pressure Piping. Therefore, ASME Section II is considered a supplementary section of the code. Part A: Ferrous Material Specifications. Part A contains material specifications for steel pipe, flanges, plates, bolting materials, and castings and wrought, cast, and malleable iron. These specifications are identified by the prefix SA followed by a number such as SA-53 or SA-106. Part B: Nonferrous Material Specifications. Part B contains materials specifica- tions for aluminum, copper, nickel, titanium, zirconium, and their alloys. These specifications are identified by the prefix SB followed by a number such as SB-61 or SB-88. Part C: Specifications for Welding Rods, Electrodes, and Filler Metals. Part C contains material specifications for welding rods, electrodes and filler materials, brazing materials, and so on. These specifications are identified by the prefix SFA followed by a number such as SFA-5.1 or SFA-5.27. Part D: Properties. Part D covers material properties of all those materials that are permitted per Sections I, III, and VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Subpart 1 contains allowable stress and design stress intensity tables for ferrous and nonferrous materials for pipe, fittings, plates, bolts, and so forth. In addition, it provides tensile strength and yield strength values for ferrous and nonferrous materials, and lists factors for limiting permanent strain in nickel, high-nickel alloys, and high-alloy steels. Subpart 2 of Part D has tables and charts providing physical properties, such as coefficient of thermal expansion, moduli of elasticity, and other technical data needed for design and construction of pressure-containing components and their supports made from ferrous and nonferrous materials. Effective Edition, Addenda, and Code Cases The application of ASME Section II is mandatory only when referenced by other sections of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, ASME B31, Code for Pressure Piping, and various other industry codes and standards.2

A.184 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS The applicable edition and addenda of ASME Section II shall correspond to the edition and addenda of the referencing code or standard. Use of a later or the latest edition and addenda of ASME Section II is permissible provided it is acceptable to the enforcement authorities having jurisdiction over the site where the component is to be installed. For items within the scope of ASME Section XI, the effective edition and addenda of ASME Section II shall be in accordance with the requirements of ASME Section XI. In case of nonnuclear items or applications, the effective edition addenda and code case shall be determined as described for ASME Section I. Use of code cases related to materials for ASME Section III applications may be made in accordance with the recommendations of Regulatory Guide 1.85, Materials Code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III, Division 1. The code cases, as approved with or without limitations and listed in Regulatory Guide 1.85, may be used. The code case(s) not listed as approved in Regulatory Guide 1.85 by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) may only be used after seeking approval from the NRC. ASME SECTION III: NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COMPONENTS Scope Division 1 of ASME Section III contains requirements for piping classified as ASME Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. ASME Section III does not delineate the criteria for classifying piping into Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3; it specifies the requirements for design, materials, fabrication, installation, examination, testing, inspection, certifi- cation, and stamping of piping systems after they have been classified Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3 based upon the applicable design criteria and Regulatory Guide 1.26, Quality Group Classifications and Standards for Water-Steam, and Radio-Waste- Containing Components of Nuclear Power Plants. Subsections NB, NC, and ND of ASME III specify the construction requirements for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 components, including piping, respectively. Subsection NF contains construction requirements for component supports, and a newly added Subsection NH contains requirements for 1 Class 1 Components in Elevated-Temperature Service. Subsec- tion NCA, which is common to Divisions 1 and 2, specifies general requirements for all components within the scope of ASME Section III. Division 3 of ASME Section III is a new addition to the code and contains requirements for containment systems and transport packaging for spent nuclear fuel and high–level radioactive waste. The construction requirements for ASME Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 piping are based on their degree of importance to safety, with Class 1 piping being subjected to the most stringent requirements and Class 3 to the least stringent requirements. It is noted that a nuclear power plant does have piping systems other than ASME Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3, which are constructed to codes other than ASME Section III. For example, the fire protection piping systems are constructed to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, and most of the nonnuclear piping systems are constructed to ASME B31.1, Power Piping Code. When joining piping systems or components of different classifications, the more restrictive requirements shall govern, except that connections between piping and

(a) Welds W1, W2, and W3 are between ASME III Class 1 pip- ing and ASME III Class 1 valves/com- ponents. These welds shall comply with the requirements for ASME III Class 1 components. Weld W4 is between ASME III Class 1 valve and ASME III Class 2 piping. This weld shall comply with the requirements for ASME III Class 2 components; (b) Welds W1, W2, and W3 are between ASME III Class 2 piping and ASME III Class 2 valves/ components. These welds shall comply with the requirements for ASME III Class 2 components. Weld W4 is be- tween ASME Class 2 valve/component and ASME III Class 3 piping. This weld shall comply with the requirements for ASME III Class 3 components; (c) Welds W1, W2, and W3 are between ASME III Class 3 piping and ASME III Class 3 valves/components. These welds shall comply with the require- ments for ASME III Class 3 compo- nents. Weld W4 is between ASME III Class 3 valve/component and ASME B31.1 piping. This weld shall comply with the requirements of ASME B31.1; (d) The connecting weld between two different ASME III classes of piping shall comply with more stringent re- quirements of the connecting classes of piping. In this case, the weld shall meet the requirements for ASME III Class 2 components; (e) The connecting weld between ASME III Class 3 and ASME B31.1 piping shall comply with more stringent requirements of ASME III Class 3 piping. other components such as vessels, tanks, heat exchangers, and valves shall be considered part of the piping. For example, a weld between an ASME Class 1 valve and ASME Class 2 piping shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Subsection NC, which contains rules for ASME Class 2 components, including piping (refer to Fig. A4.2). Effective Edition, Addenda, and Code Cases Selection of effective editions and addenda of ASME Section III shall be based upon the following guidelines: Only the approved edition(s) and addenda of ASME Section III, incorporated by reference in 10 CFR 50.55a, Paragraph (b) (1) are to be used for construction of items within the scope of ASME Section III.

A.186 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS The latest published edition and addenda of ASME Section III may not be approved by the U.S. NRC; therefore, their use can only be made after seeking special permission from the U.S. NRC. Refer to 10 CFR 50.55a, Codes and Standards from time to time to find which edition and addenda of ASME Section III have been approved by the U.S. NRC. As per Subsubarticle NCA-1140, in no case shall the code edition and addenda dates established in the design specifications be earlier than three years prior to the date the nuclear power plant construction permit application is docketed. In addition, the guidelines of preceding paragraphs shall apply3: Code editions and addenda later than those established in the design specification and documents per the above-delineated approach may be used provided they are approved for use. Also, specific provisions within an edition or addenda later than those established in the design specifications and documents may be used provided all related requirements are met. All code items, including piping systems, may be constructed to a single code edition and addenda, or each item may be constructed to individually specified code editions and addenda. The use of code case(s) is optional. Only the U.S. NRC–approved code cases with or without limitations or additional requirements published in the following regulatory guides may be used without a specific request to the U.S. NRC for ap- proval: Regulatory Guide 1.84: Design and Fabrication Code Case Acceptability ASME Section III, Division 1. Regulatory Guide 1.85: Materials Code Case Acceptability ASME Section III, Division 1. The code cases not listed as approved in Regulatory Guides 1.84 and 1.85 may be used only after seeking permission from the U.S. NRC for the specific application. ASME SECTION V: NONDESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION Scope ASME Section V comprises Subsection A, Subsection B, and mandatory and non- mandatory appendixes. Subsection A delineates the methods of nondestructive examination, and Subsection B contains various ASTM standards covering nonde- structive examination methods that have been adopted as standards. The standards contained in Subsection B are for information only and are nonmandatory unless specifically referenced in whole or in part in Subsection A or referenced in other code sections and other codes, such as ASME B31, Pressure Piping Code. The nondestructive examination requirements and methods included in ASME Section V are mandatory to the extent they are invoked by other codes and standards or by the purchaser’s specifications. For example, ASME Section III requires radio- graphic examination of some welds to be performed in accordance with Article 2 of ASME Section V.5 ASME Section V does not contain acceptance standards for the nondestructive examination methods covered in Subsection A. The acceptance criteria or standards shall be those contained in the referencing code or standard.

PIPING CODES AND STANDARDS A.187 Effective Edition, Addenda, and Code Cases The applicable edition and addenda of ASME Section V shall correspond to the edition and addenda of the referencing code. ASME SECTION VIII: PRESSURE VESSELS Scope The rules of ASME Section VIII constitute construction requirements for pressure vessels. Division 2 of ASME Section VIII delineates alternative rules of construction to Division 1 requirements. However, there are some differences between the scopes of the two divisions. Recently added Division 3 provides Alternative Rules for Construction of High-Pressure Vessels. The rules of ASME Section VIII apply to flanges, bolts, closures, and pressure- relieving devices of a piping system when and where required by the code governing the construction of the piping. For example, ASME B31.1 requires that the safety and relief valves on nonboiler external piping, except for reheat safety valves, shall be in accordance with the requirements of ASME Section VIII, Division 1, UG- 126 through UG-133. Effective Edition, Addenda, and Code Cases Editions are effective on—and may be used on or after—the date of publication printed on the title page. Addenda are effective on—and may be used on or after—the date of issue. Addenda and revisions become mandatory as minimum requirements six months after date of issuance, except for pressure vessels contracted for prior to the end of the six-month period. Code cases may be used beginning with the date of their approval by the ASME. Use of revisions and addenda and code cases that are less restrictive than former requirements must not be made without assurance that they have been accepted by the proper authorities in the jurisdiction where the pressure vessel is to be installed. ASME SECTION IX: WELDING AND BRAZING QUALIFICATIONS Scope ASME Section IX consists of two parts—Part QW and Part QB—which deal with welding and brazing, respectively. In addition, ASME Section IX contains mandatory and nonmandatory appendixes. ASME Section IX requirements relate to the qualification of welders, welding operators, brazers, and brazing operators and the procedures used in welding and brazing. They establish the basic criteria for welding and brazing observed in the preparation of welding and brazing requirements that affect procedure and perfor- mance.

A.188 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS ASME Section IX is a supplemental code. The requirements of ASME Section IX apply when referenced by the governing code or standard or when specified in purchaser’s specification. It is usually referenced in other sections of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and the ASME B31, Pressure Piping Code. Effective Edition, Addenda, and Code Cases The applicable edition and addenda of ASME Section IX shall correspond to the edition and addenda of the referencing code. However, the later or the latest edition or addenda of ASME Section IX may be used, provided it is acceptable to the enforcement authorities having jurisdiction. For safety-related items of an operating nuclear power plant, application of ASME Section IX will be in accordance with the requirements of ASME Section XI, Rules for Inservice Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components. For nonsafety-related items, the following guidelines apply: ●Editions are effective and may be used on or after the date of publication on the title page. ●Addenda are effective and may be used on or after the date of issue. ●Addenda and revisions become mandatory as minimum requirements six months after the date of issue, except for pressure vessels or boilers contracted for prior to the end of the six-month period. ●Code cases may be used beginning with the date of their approval by the ASME. ●Use of revisions and addenda and code cases that are less restrictive than former requirements must not be made without assurance they have been accepted by the proper authorities in the jurisdiction where the item is to be installed. ASME SECTION XI: RULES FOR IN-SERVICE INSPECTION OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COMPONENTS Scope ASME Section XI comprises three divisions, each covering rules for inspection and testing of components of different types of nuclear power plants. These three divisions are as follows: ASME Section XI, Division 1: Rules for Inspection and Testing of Components of Light-Water-Cooled Plants ASME Section XI, Division 2: Rules for Inspection and Testing of Components of Gas-Cooled Plants ASME Section XI, Division 3: Rules for Inspection and Testing of Components of Liquid-Metal-Cooled Plants. Since the publication of the first edition of ASME Section XI in 1971, significant changes and additions have been incorporated, and as such, the organization of the later versions of ASME Section XI, Division 1, is considerably different from that of the first edition.

PIPING CODES AND STANDARDS A.189 ASME Section XI, Division 1, provides the rules and requirements for in-service inspection and testing of light-water-cooled nuclear power plants. The rules and requirements identify, as a minimum, the areas subject to inspection, responsibilities, provisions for accessibility and inspectability, examination methods and procedures, personnel qualifications, frequency of inspection, record-keeping and report re- quirements, procedures for evaluating inspection results, subsequent disposition of results of evaluations, and repair requirements. Division 1 also provides for the design, fabrication, installation, and inspection of replacements. The jurisdiction of Division 1 of ASME Section XI covers individual components and complete power plants that have met all the requirements of the construction code, commencing at that time when the construction code require- ments have been met, irrespective of physical location. When portions of systems or plants are completed at different times, the jurisdic- tion of Division 1 shall cover only those portions on which all of the construction code requirements have been met. Rules of ASME Section XI apply to ASME Classes 1, 2, 3, and MC components and their supports, core support structures, pumps, and valves. Rules of ASME Section XI, Division 1, apply to modifications made to ASME III components and their supports after all of the original construction code require- ments have been met. Rules of ASME Section XI, Division 1, apply to systems, portions of systems, components, and their supports not originally constructed to ASME Section III requirements but based on their importance to safety if they were classified as ASME Classes 1, 2, 3, and MC. Effective Edition, Addenda, and Code Cases Section 10 CFR 50.55a, Codes and Standards, of the Code of Federal Regulations requires compliance with ASME Section XI for operating nuclear power plants. In addition, 10 CFR 50.55a, Paragraph (b)(2) delineates the editions and addenda of ASME Section XI that are approved for use. Only the approved editions and addenda of ASME Section XI are to be used. The latest published edition and addenda may not be approved by the U.S. NRC; therefore, they can only be used after seeking special permission from the U.S. NRC. It is recommended that one refer to 10 CFR 50.55a from time to time to determine which edition and addenda of ASME Section XI have been approved by the U.S. NRC and which edition and addenda may be applicable to a nuclear power plant at a particular time. The requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a are based on the construction permit (CP) docket date and the operating license (OL) date of the nuclear plant. Code editions and addenda later than those established for a particular applica- tion in conformance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a may be used provided they are approved and all related requirements of respective editions or addenda are met. While establishing a particular edition and addenda of ASME Section XI, con- sider the limitations and modifications to the specific editions and addenda deline- ated in Paragraph (b)(2) of 10 CFR 50.55a, and ensure compliance to those limita- tions and modifications, as applicable. For repairs and replacements, the applicable edition and addenda shall be the one in effect for that in-service inspection (ISI) interval during which the repairs

Applicable Code Cases Like the code edition and addenda, code cases are regularly reviewed by the U.S. NRC. The U.S. NRC–approved code cases with or without limitations or additional requirements are published in the Regulatory Guide 1.147, In-Service Inspection Code Case Acceptability of ASME Section XI, Division 1.4 Acceptance or endorsement by the U.S. NRC staff applies only to those code cases or code case revisions with the date of ASME Council approval, as shown in the Regulatory Guide 1.147. ASME B31: CODE FOR PRESSURE PIPING Starting with Project B31 in March 1926, the first edition of American tentative Standard Code for Pressure Piping was published in 1935. In view of continuous industry developments and increases in diversified needs over the years, decisions were made to publish several sections of the Code for Pressure Piping. Since December 1978, the American National Standards Committee B31 was reorganized as the ASME Code for Pressure Piping B31 Committee under procedures developed by the ASME and accredited by ANSI. Presently, the following sections of ASME B31, Code for Pressure Piping are pub- lished:* ASME B31.1 Power Piping USAS B31.2 Fuel Gas Piping ASME B31.3 Process Piping ASME B31.4 Liquid Transportation Systems for Hy- drocarbons, Liquid Petroleum Gas, Anhydrous Ammonia, and Alcohol ASME B31.5 Refrigeration Piping ASME B31.8 Gas Transmission and Distribution Pip- ing Systems ASME B31.9 Building Services Piping ASME B31.11 Slurry Transportation Piping Systems ASME B31.1: POWER PIPING CODE Scope ASME B31.1, Power Piping Code, prescribes requirements for the design, material, fabrication, erection, test, and inspection of power and auxiliary service piping * USAS B31.2 was withdrawn in 1988, but it is available for historical and reference purposes.

PIPING CODES AND STANDARDS A.191 systems for electric generation stations, industrial and institutional plants, central and district heating plants, and district heating systems. It does not apply to piping systems covered by other sections of the Code for Pressure Piping, and other piping which is specifically excluded from the scope of this code.7 As explained earlier, the BEP is required to meet administrative jurisdictional requirements of ASME Section I; however, pipe connections meeting all other requirements of ASME B31.1 but not exceeding nominal pipe size (NPS) ¹⁄₂ may be welded to boiler external pipe or boiler headers without inspection and stamping required by ASME Section I. Nonboiler external piping is defined as all the piping covered by ASME B31.1 with the exception of BEP. The nonboiler external piping must be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this code. In addition to the piping systems covered by other sections of ASME B31, Pressure Piping Code, ASME B31.1 does not cover the following: ●Economizers, heaters, pressure vessels, and components covered by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (except the connecting piping not covered by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code shall meet the requirements of ASME B31.1) ●Building heating and distribution steam piping designed for 15 psig (100 kPa gauge) or less, or hot-water heating systems piping designed for 30 psig (200 kPa gauge) or less ●Piping for roof and floor drains, plumbing, sewers, and sprinkler and other fire- protection systems ●Piping for hydraulic or pneumatic tools and their components downstream of the first stop valve off the system distribution header ●Piping for marine or other installations under federal control ●Piping covered by other sections of ASME B31 and ASME Section III ●Fuel gas piping within the scope of ANSI Z 223.1, National Fuel Gas Code ●Pulverized fuel piping within the scope of NFPA The requirements of this code apply to central and district heating systems for distribution of steam and hot water away from the plants whether underground or elsewhere, and geothermal steam and hot water piping both to and from wellheads. The construction of fuel gas or fuel oil piping brought to plant site from a distribution system inside the plant property line is governed by the requirements of ASME B31.1 when the meter assembly is located outside the plant property line. In cases where the meter assembly is located within the plant property line, the requirements of this code shall apply to the fuel gas and fuel oil piping down- stream from the outlet of the meter assembly (see Fig. A4.3). This code also applies to gas and oil systems piping other than that shown in Fig. A4.3. It covers air systems, hydraulic fluid systems piping, and the steam-jet cooling systems piping which are part of the power plant cycle. In addition, building services within the scope of ASME B31.9 but outside the limits of Paragraph 900.1.2 of B31.9 are required to be designed in accordance with ASME B31.1.

PIPING CODES AND STANDARDS A.193 testing activities for the piping system(s) until the completion of the work and initial operation.7 Unless agreement is specifically reached between the contracting parties, no code edition and/or addenda shall be retroactive. Code cases may be used after they have been approved by the ASME Council. The provisions of a code case may be used even after its expiration or withdrawal, provided the code case was effective on the original contract date and it was used for original construction or was adopted prior to completion of work and the contracting parties agreed to its use. Do not use revisions and code cases that are less restrictive than former require- ments without having assurance that they have been accepted by the proper authori- ties in the jurisdictions where the piping is to be installed. USAS B31.2: FUEL GAS PIPING In 1955 a decision was made to publish separate code sections of B31, Code for Pressure Piping. Consequently, Section 2 of B31.1-1955 was updated and revised to publish as USAS B31.2—1968, Fuel Gas Piping. No edition of this code section was published after 1968. This code was withdrawn in 1988. Scope USAS B31.2 covers the design, fabrication, installation, and testing of piping systems for fuel gases such as natural gas, manufactured gas, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); air mixtures above the upper combustible limit; LPG in the gaseous phase; or mixtures of these gases. This code applies to fuel gas piping systems both within and between the build- ings, from the outlet of the consumer meter assembly, and to and including the first pressure-containing valve upstream of the gas utilization device. This code does not apply to: ●Vacuum piping systems ●Fuel gas piping systems with metal temperatures above 450�F or below �20�F ●Fuel gas piping systems within petroleum refineries, loading terminals, natural gas processing plants, bulk plants, compounding plants, or refinery tank farms, and so forth within the scope of USAS B31.3 ●Fuel gas piping systems in power and atomic energy plants within the scope of USAS B31.1 ●Fuel gas piping systems within the scope of USAS B31.8 ●Fuel gas piping systems within the scope of USAS Z21.30 ●Piping systems within the scope of USAS Z106.1 ●Proprietary items of equipment, apparatus, or instruments, such as compressors, gas-generating sets, and calorimeters ●Design and fabrication of pressure vessels covered by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code ●Support structures and equipment such as stanchions, towers, building frames, pressure vessels, mechanical equipment, and foundations

For a short period of time, from 1967 to 1969, it was called the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI). ANSI provides a forum for development or obtaining a consensus for approval of standards having national impact and serves as a focal point for distribution of national and other standards, including those developed and issued by the Interna- tional Organization for Standardization (ISO) and foreign governments. Develop- ment and approval functions are performed by committees representing a cross section of affected interests, such as engineering societies, manufacturers, trade institutes, fabricators, builders, universities, unions, insurance companies, and gov- ernment agencies. Many of the committees are chaired or sponsored by engineering societies, such as ASME and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engi- neers (IEEE). Safety is the basic objective of the engineering design and construction require- ments contained in standards developed, approved, and distributed by ANSI. The ANSI standards include prohibition for practices considered unsafe and cautions where advisory warnings, instead of prohibitions, are deemed necessary. This chapter provides a brief discussion of various sections of ASME B31, Pressure Piping Code, which was earlier known as ANSI B31, Pressure Piping Code. It is envisioned that other ANSI standards may eventually become known as ASME standards; however, they shall be subjected to approval of the ANSI. The following ANSI standards contain provisions related to piping. ANSI Standards A13.1-96 Scheme for the Identification of Piping Systems A112.1.2-91 Air Gaps in Plumbing Systems

It also tests items for conformance to these and other nationally recognized standards and publishes lists of items approved as a result of the tests. The NFPA codes require that items to be used in fire protection and prevention systems be approved and listed. The UL-published UL Fire Protection Equipment List (such as a listing of fire-loop piping material and equipment manufacturers) is one of the publications normally used by those involved in piping associated with fire protection systems. FOREIGN CODES AND STANDARDS The basic principles of piping design and construction may not differ much from one country to another, but the requirements of country-specific codes and standards may vary substantially. Therefore, the personnel involved in the engineering design, construction, operation, and maintenance of piping systems must ensure that the requirements of applicable codes and standards are complied with to ensure the safety of the general public and workers associated with the facility. The user is advised to verify the latest applicable version/edition of the code and/or standard before invoking their requirements for any application.

CHAPTER A5 MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE Alfred Lohmeier Materials Engineer (Formerly Vice President—Technical) Sumitomo Corporation of America New York, New York Daniel R. Avery Technical Marketing Manager Wyman-Gordan Forgings, Inc. Houston, Texas DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIAL PIPE-MAKING There have been increasing societal demands for modern structures and facilities and concomitant increased emphasis on safety and reliability of equipment under all operating conditions. Piping manufacturing processes have been developed to provide the quality and reliability commensurate with these demands, together with economically feasible production methods. To meet the more stringent reliability goals, the quality control of the piping manufacturing process from the production of the raw material to the finished product is of significant importance. Driving the need for process quality improvement are the social and economic consequences of equipment failure in critical applications such as power generation, chemical and petroleum production, and transportation. This chapter considers the methods by which different types of metallic pipe are produced. It also considers the various steel-making processes which are impor- tant to the ultimate quality of the manufactured pipe. For a discussion of pipes made of thermoplastic and fiberglass, refer to Part D of this handbook. Historical Background The history of pipe manufacturing goes back to the use of hollow wooden logs to provide water for medieval cities. The use of cast-iron pipes in England and France A.243

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.244 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS became prevalent in the early nineteenth century. The first major cast-iron water pipeline for Philadelphia was obtained in 1817 and for New York in 1832. Distribu- tion of gas for gaslights was initiated in England, using sheet iron drawn through a die to a cylindrical shape and with the edges welded together. In 1887 the first pipe was made of Bethlehem steel in the United States. Seamless pipe manufacture was attempted in the mid–nineteenth century by various means; the Mannesmann process was developed in Germany in 1885 and operated commercially in England in 1887. The first seamless pipe mill in the United States was built in 1895. In the early twentieth century, seamless tubes gained wide acceptance as the Industrial Revolution proceeded with automobiles, oil refineries, oil pipelines, oil wells, and fossil power generation boilers. At that time, the welded tube had not achieved the reliability of present-day electric resistance welded tubes. The development of pipe and tube production methods, together with the devel- opment of steel alloys capable of withstanding the demanding environmental condi- tions of temperature, chemistry, pressure, and cyclic thermal and pressure load application have enabled pipe and tube to be used reliably in the most critical applications, ranging from Alaskan pipelines to nuclear power generation plants. World Tubular Product Production Capability World production and consumption of iron and steel tubular products makes up almost 14 percent of the worldwide crude steel conversion. World production of steel tubular products is continuously increasing to meet the demands of world- wide industrialization and growing population. The production of iron and steel tubular products vary depending on a wide range of worldwide economic factors such as oil exploration, power generation plant construction, and automotive pro- duction. For example, in economic climates where oil prices are low, there is less incentive to drill new oil wells. Consequently, the production of steel pipe for oil drilling casings would be reduced. Similar examples of steel pipe production as a function of economic climate can be seen in the power generation and automotive industries. Total world production of pipe is an integration of the effects of the local national economic climates throughout the world. FERROUS PIPE-MAKING PROCESSES Iron-Making The making of steel for ferritic piping begins with the smelting of iron ore found in deposits in the crust of the earth throughout the world in forms such as hematite and magnetite. In preparation for the smelting process, the iron ore may be treated by any of several methods to convert it into a suitable form for introduction into the blast furnaces. One method is sintering, which converts ores into a porous mass called clinkers. Another is smelting, which is performed in a blast furnace. The process involves the chemical reaction of iron ore with limestone, coke, and air under heat, reducing the iron ore to iron. The ‘‘pig’’ iron obtained from the blast furnace is used as the basic component in the steel-making process.

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.245 Steel-Making Steel for piping can be produced in several ways (Fig. A5.1), depending on the facilities available and the desired characteristic of the steel. Generally, steel requires FIGURE A5.1 Piping steel-making processes. the removal of carbon from the pig iron to a degree required by the carbon steel properties desired. Alloy steel also requires the addition of alloying elements such as chromium, nickel, manganese, and molybdenum to provide the special properties associated with the alloying element. Bessemer Converter. The Bessemer method of making steel (due to Sir Henry Bessemer in 1856) consisted of blowing a current of cold air through the molten pig iron, thereby using the oxygen in the air to burn carbon and other impurities from the melt. After burning out the carbon in the pig iron, the exact amount of carbon required for the steel is reintroduced into the heat. Basic Oxygen Process. The basic oxygen process (BOP) is essentially the same as the Bessemer process except that it uses pure oxygen (instead of air) together with burned lime converted from limestone. This process burns out the impurities more quickly and completely and provides for more precise control of the steel chemistry. Open-Hearth Furnace. The open-hearth furnace is used to produce much of the steel in the United States; however, it is being superseded by the basic oxygen process. Its significant advantage is the ability to use scrap steel as well as pig iron

A.246 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS as ferrous stock in producing steel. The open-hearth furnace is a large rectangular brick floor, or hearth, completely covered with a brick structure through which the charge of ferrous stock and limestone is introduced. It is fueled with coke gas, oil, or tar introduced through a burner playing a flame across the hearth while the products of combustion escape through the furnace wall away from the burner. An advantage of the open-hearth process is that testing for carbon content during the heating is possible, allowing adjustments to be made to the feed-stock at that time to control the chemistry of the product. Electric Arc Furnace. The electric arc furnace is a large kettle-shaped chamber lined with fire brick, into which a charge of steel scrap with coke is melted by means of heat produced by an electric arc. Since no burning of fuel is required, the oxygen of the steel can be controlled and kept to a minimum. Alloying elements can be added without the fear of oxidation. Because of the control of heat time, tempera- ture, and chemistry, the electric arc furnace is used in the production of high-quality alloy steels. Argon Oxygen Process. The argon oxygen process (AOP) is used in the production of specialty steels with low carbon and sulfur and high chromium content. A charge of steel of almost the desired properties is introduced into a basic oxygen furnacelike vessel, and controlled amounts of oxygen and argon are introduced into the melt. This reducing process conserves valuable chromium. Vacuum Degassing Process. When exceptionally high quality steel is required, steel can be ‘‘degassed’’ in a vacuum environment. This vacuum degassing process provides strong reduction in hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, inclusions, and contami- nants such as lead, copper, tin, and arsenic. Ingots, Blooms, and Billets. Ingots, blooms, and billets are the shapes into which the molten metal is solidified before using it in a particular pipe-making (or other) process. An ingot is poured from the molten steel and after solidification goes to the blooming mill to be rolled into square blooms, which are further formed onto bar rounds. Alternately, in the case of large pipe, the ingot may be formed into pierced billets to be used in the seamless tube-making process. Continuous Casting Process. Although the development of the continuous casting process (Fig. A5.2) began in the nineteenth century, it was after World War II that its use became of great commercial interest. In the continuous casting process, molten steel is poured from the melting furnace to a ladle feeding a reservoir called a tundish. The tundish feeds a lubricated mold that has a cooled copper surface, and the solidifying steel is continuously drawn from the mold. In the case of piping steel, the mold is the shape of the billet or slab used in the tube-making process. There are many types of continuous casting processes, ranging from vertical to horizontal, with variations of bent sections in between. This process is now used in more than half the world’s steel production. In Japan, 85 percent of the total steel produced is by the continuous casting process. Pipe- and Tube-Forming Processes There are basically two types of pipe- and tube-forming processes, namely, seamless and welded. Each process imparts unique properties to the pipe or tube. Seamless

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.247 FIGURE A5.2 Continuous casting process. pipe or tube does not have the presence of a welded seam along the length of the pipe. This seam has traditionally been believed to be a potential weakness. The development of automated welding processes and quality control, however, has made this a virtually nonexistent concern. The control of thickness uniformity and concentricity is relatively easy with welded pipe and tube. In general, the seamless pipe is more expensive to produce. The classification of cylindrical tubular products in terms of either pipe or tube is a function of end use. This is discussed further under Tubular Product Classification. Seamless Pipe. Seamless tube and pipe (Fig. A5.3) are manufactured by first producing a hollow tube which is larger in diameter and thickness than the final tube or pipe. The billet is first pierced by either a rotary (Mannesmann) piercer or by a press piercing method. For tubes of small diameter, the mandrel mill process is used. For medium outside diameter tubes of carbon or low-alloy steel, the Mannes- mann plug mill process is used. Large-diameter, heavy-wall carbon steel, alloy, and stainless pipe is manufactured by the Erhardt push bench process and vertical extrusion similar to the Ugine Sejournet type extrusion process. High-alloy and specially shaped pipe are manufactured by the Ugine Sejournet extrusion-type process. These processes are performed with the material at hot-metal-forming temperatures. Further cold processing may or may not be performed to obtain further dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and surface metallurgical structure. Mandrel (Pilger) Mill Process. In the mandrel (pilger) mill process (Fig. A5.4), a steel billet is heated to forging temperature and placed between the rolls of a hot rotary piercing mill. A piercing point is placed at the center of the billet, and the rotating rolls are designed to advance the billet over the piercing point, thereby forming a hole through the center of the billet along its entire length as it advances

A.248 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A5.3 Seamless tube and pipe manufacturing processes. into the tilted rolls. A mandrel of outside diameter approximately that of the inside finished pipe diameter is pressed into the pierced hole of the billet. This combination of mandrel and billet is placed between rolls of a pilger-mill having a cam-shaped contour revolving counter to the direction in which the billet is being forced by means of a hydraulic and pneumatic ram mechanism. FIGURE A5.4 Mandrel (pilger) mill process.

*Source: piping-handbook*

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.249 In the pilger-mill, the rolls first grab the hot billet and after some rotation form a shaft. The pressure of the rolls forces the billet backward, and the resulting tube section is squeezed and smoothed out in the adjacent part of the roll groove. This process is equivalent to forging the billet against the mandrel and driving the billet and mandrel against the ram. After reaching the open portion of the cam shape, the ram mechanism again forces the billet into the rolls. Following the pilger- mill process, the tube is reheated and passed through a reducer or sizer to provide a more uniform diameter. The resulting tube or pipe is called hot finished seamless. The pilger-mill process is slower than conventional drawing. However, since large reductions in diameter are possible in a single pass, the process is applied to the production of tubes of small diame- ter such as heat exchangers, fossil fuel boilers, and nuclear steam generators. Mannesmann Plug-Mill Process. In the Mannesmann plug-mill process (Fig. A5.5) the billet may be pierced in two hot rotary piercers because of the greater reduction needed for medium- size pipe and tube. Following the pierc- ing process, the pierced billet is placed in a plug-mill, which reduces the diame- ter by rotating the tube over a mandrel. Having some ovality, the tube is next inserted between the rolls of reelers which provide for dimensional correc- tion and burnish the inside and outside diameters of the tube. Finally, after re- heating, the tube reenters a reeler and sizing rollers to provide for greater di- mensional uniformity. The Mannesmann plug-mill process is a standard process for making large quantities of thin-wall stainless steel FIGURE A5.5 Mannesmann plug-mill process. tube or pipe of uniform size and round- ness throughout its entire length. Ugine Sejournet Type Extrusion Processes. The Ugine Sejournet extrusion process (Fig. A5.6) is used for high-alloy steel tubes and pipe such as those of stainless steel and specially shaped pipe. A descaled billet, heated to approximately 2300�F (1260�C), is placed in the vertical press compartment with an extrusion die at its bottom. After applying a hydraulic ram to the billet, a piercing mandrel within the ram punches the billet, producing a cylinder from which the punch piece is ejected through the extrusion die opening. Following this, the ram is activated to apply pressure to the billet, and the billet is extruded through the annulus formed between the piercing mandrel and die cavity. In horizontal presses, piercing is done as a separate operation, or a hollow is used with a mandrel and die. The mandrels and dies are made of high-alloy steels containing tungsten, molybdenum, and chromium having Rockwell C hardness values of approximately 46. Powdered glass is the lubricant used in this process. Heavy-wall pipe in sizes NPS 8–48 (DN 200–1200), having a wall thickness ranging from 1 in (25 mm) to 6 in (150 mm), is extruded vertically to 45 ft (14 m) lengths using procedural steps in the Ugine Sejournet process and a graphite lubricant. These large extrusions of carbon-, alloy-, and

Heavy-wall pipe per ASTM A335, Grades P11, P22, and P91 is increasingly being used in power generation. In addition, heavy- wall pipe is utilized in offshore oil drilling and production. Forged Seamless Pipe. Forged pipe is used for large-diameter, NPS 10–30 (DN 250–750), and thickness, 1.5–4 in (40–100 mm), pipe, where equipment availability and cost for other seamless grades are limiting. There are two processes available for the production of forged seamless pipe, namely, forged and bored pipe and hollow forged pipe. Forged and Bored Seamless Pipe. In the forged and bored process a billet or ingot heated to forging temperature is elongated by forging in heavy presses or forging hammers to a diameter slightly larger than that of the finished pipe. After turning in a lathe to the desired outside diameter, the inside diameter is bored to the specified internal diameter dimensions. The resulting pipe can be made to very close tolerances. Sections 50 ft (15 m) long have been produced by this process. Hollow Forged Seamless Pipe Erhardt Type Process. The Erhardt process (Fig. A5.7), developed by Heinrich Erhardt in Germany in 1891, consists of heating a

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.251 FIGURE A5.7 Hollow-forged seamless pipe—Erhardt-type process. square ingot to forging temperature, placing it into a circularly hollow die, and incompletely piercing it with a vertical piercing mandrel such that a cup shape is obtained. As a result of the piercing at forging temperature, the square ingot becomes the (circular) shape of the die. After reheating, the cup-shaped shell is mounted on a mandrel and pushed through a series of dies to the desired diameter and wall thickness, after which the cupped end is removed and the inside and outside pipe diameters are machined. This process is used for large-diameter and heavy-wall seamless pipe for boiler headers and main steam line piping. It can be applied to produce low and medium carbon steel pipe (ASTM A53, A106, A161, A179, A192, A210), stainless steel pipe (TP329, TP304, TP304L, TP321, TP347, TP316), and high nickel alloys (A333, A334). Cold and Hot Finishing of Seamless Pipe and Tube. Pipe that has been pro- duced by the Mannesmann plug-mill, mandrel mill, Ugine Sejournet, or Erhardt forging process can be used as hot finished seamless steel pipe or tube if the application does not require further finishing. If further finishing is required, the pipe or tube may be further reduced by a cold reduction process (Fig. A5.8). If the cold reduction processes are used, the reduced tube must be heat-treated in a furnace such as a bright annealing furnace or in a continuous barrel furnace. Subsequent to the heat treatment of the cold finished pipe, the pipe must pass through a straight- ening process which corrects any nonstraight sections caused in the pipe by the heat treatment of cold reduced pipe. The straighteners are either a series of rolls

A.252 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A5.8 Cold and hot finishings of seamless pipe and tube. through which the pipes pass cold or a device which bends the pipe at discreet locations along the pipe. The resulting product is called cold finished seamless pipe or tube. In applications of tube to fossil fuel boilers, cold finishing is sometimes specified. Cold finishing improves the surface finish and dimensional accuracy. Some boiler manufacturers, however, consider the hot finished tube surface satisfactory and specify it as such because of its reduced cost. Welded Pipe. Welded pipe is produced by forming a cylinder from flat steel sheets coming from a hot strip mill. The strip mill takes the square bloom from the blooming mill and reduces it into plates, skelp, or coils of strip steel to be fed into the particular welding process equipment. Butt-weld pipe is made by furnace heating and forge welding or by fusion welding using electric resistance, flash, submerged- arc welding, inert-gas tungsten-arc welding, or gas-shielded consumable metal-arc welding. The welded seam is either parallel to the tube axis or in a spiral direction about the tube centerline. Furnace-Welded (Continuous or Butt-Welded) Pipe. This is a low-cost carbon steel pipe below 4-in diameter made of steel from open-hearth or basic oxygen Bessemer steel. In this process, skelp is heated to welding temperature in a continu- ous furnace and passed through forming and welding rolls, welding the strip edges at the same time the tube is formed. Strips can be consecutively resistance-welded to each other to form a continuous pipe. Fusion-Welded Pipe. Fusion-welded pipe is produced by resistance-welding, induction-welding, or arc-welding. Electric Resistance-Welded Pipe. In the electric resistance-welded (ERW) pipe process (Fig. A5.9), upon exiting the forming mill, the longitudinal edges of the cylinder formed are welded by flash-welding, low-frequency resistance-welding,

*Source: piping-handbook*

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.253 FIGURE A5.9 Electric resistance welded pipe process. high-frequency induction-welding, or high-frequency resistance-welding. All pro- cesses begin with the forming of the cylinder with the longitudinal seam butt edges ready to be welded. In the flash-welding process, the butted cylinder surfaces are placed in contact; a voltage is applied across the contact, causing metal flashing along the seam length and raising the steel temperature locally to the metal-forming temperature. After this, the seam edges are pressed together and a pressure fusion-weld is formed at a temperature lower than the steel melting point. The upset material along both the inside and outside of the seam is removed with a scarfing tool. This process is used to produce high-strength carbon steel pipe from NPS 4 to 36 (DN 100 to 900). In the low-frequency resistance method, electric current and pressure are simulta- neously applied, and the resulting heat causes melting of the edges. The resulting seam is similar to that from the flash-welding process and requires removal of the upset material. Postweld heat treatment may be desirable for stress relief, tempering, or recrystallization. This process is applied to pipe of outside diameters up to NPS 22 (DN 550). High-frequency welding process, using an alternating current of more than 400,000 Hz, is similar to the low-frequency resistance welding process. The lower inductance path followed by the current produces a smaller high-temperature band that minimizes the amount of upset material. This process is used for pipe up to NPS 42 (DN 1050). For production of small-diameter pipe at high rates of production, the high- frequency induction-welding process may be used. In this process, an induction coil raises the seam temperature to welding temperature. The rapid increase in temperature caused by the high-frequency current causes little upsetting because of the resulting control of temperature and fusion. Several arc-welding processes are used in commercial welded pipe production. These include the submerged-arc-welding process, the inert-gas tungsten-arc-weld- ing process, and the gas-shielded consumable metal-arc-welding process.

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.254 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS In the submerged-arc-welding process, bare wire consumable electrodes are added to the weld metal under a blanket of flux. The melting flux creates a protective atmosphere of inert gas and a slag blanket over the solidifying weld metal. In heavy- wall piping, simultaneous submerged arc seam welds on inner and outer sides of the pipe are sometimes used to build up the weld thickness to the desired level. In modern pipe production facilities, automated equipment is used to control all vari- ables in the submerged arc process, including relative movement speed between pipe and welding heads, wire feed rate, welding current, and flux feed rate. Sub- merged-arc seam-welded pipe is used in critical high-temperature or high-pressure applications in the electrical power generation process and chemical industries. For carbon steel and stainless steel pipe of smaller wall thickness, the inert-gas tungsten-arc-welding process is used. The weld is protected by an inert gas such as argon or helium, which forms a blanket over the weld metal. For thicker-wall pipe, a filler wire may be fed into the protective gas blanket. For thin-wall pipe, no filler is used. A number of variations in pipe forming before welding are used, including molding, pressing, or rolling strip into cylinders. Spiral Welded Pipe. Lightweight pipe for temporary or light operation duty such as in water systems applications may be made by the spiral-welded process. In this process, narrow strips of steel sheet are helically wound into cylinders. The edges of this strip can either be butting or overlapping and are welded by any of several electric arc-welding processes. Cast Pipe Cast-Iron Pipe. There are four basic types of cast iron: white iron, gray iron, ductile iron, and malleable iron. White iron is characterized by the prevalence of carbides which impart high compressive strength, hardness, and resistance to wear. Gray cast iron has graphite in the microstructure, giving good machinability and resistance to wear and galling. Ductile iron is gray iron with small amounts of magnesium or cesium which bring about nodularization of the graphite, resulting in both high strength and ductility. Malleable iron is white cast iron which has been heat-treated to provide for ductility. Cast-iron pipe is extensively used for underlying water, sewage, and gas distribu- tion systems because of its long life expectancy. Specifications for this pipe can be found under Federal Specification W-W-P-421b-Pipe, Cast Iron, Pressure (for Water and Other Liquids). Cast-iron pipe is produced from four processes: vertical pit casting, horizontal casting, centrifugal sand mold casting, and centrifugal metal mold casting. Vertical Pit Process. The vertical pit process for producing pipe requires a sand mold formed into a pipe pattern of the outer surface of the pipe, into which a separately made core is placed. The molten iron is poured into the vertical annulus between the outer mold and the core. American Standard Specifications for Cast Iron Pit Cast Pipe for Water or Other Liquids are available in ASTM Specification A 377. Pit-cast pipe specifications for the gas industry may be found in American Gas Association (AGA) Standards for Cast Iron Pipe and Special Castings. ASTM Designation A142 provides specifications for pit-cast culvert pipe. Horizontal Process. In the horizontal cast-iron pipe process, horizontal outer molds are made in halves, with a core formed around a perforated horizontal bar. After the top half is placed on the bottom half, the molten iron is introduced in a manner preventing ladle slag from entering the mold. Centrifugally Cast-Iron Pipe. There are two types of centrifugal casting ma- chines—horizontal and vertical. Pipe is most commonly produced in the horizontal machine. The centrifugal castings are formed after molten metal is poured into a

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.255 rotating mold. The mold continues its rotation until solidification of the metal is complete, after which the casting is removed. Molds can be made of sand or, for permanent molds, graphite, carbon, or steel. The centrifugal casting process provides a means of producing high-quality castings which are defect-free due to the absence of shrinking. These castings cool from the outside to the inside, providing a desirable directional solidification which results in cleaner and denser castings than those resulting from static casting methods. Cast-Steel Pipe. Cast-steel pipe is produced by either static or centrifugal casting processes. In the horizontal centrifugal casting machine, the molten steel is introduced into the rotating mold of sand, ceramics, or metal. Centrifugally cast pipe can be obtained in sizes up to NPS 54 (DN 1350). Application of this pipe can be found in paper mill rolls, gun barrels, and high-temperature and pressure service in refineries (temperatures above 1000�F or 538�C). This process is also used for high-nickel and high-nickel alloy pipes. Cold-Wrought Steel Pipe. Centrifugally cast stainless steel pipe can be cold expanded subsequent to casting by internally applied pressure to form cold-wrought pipe. The process, called hydroforging, applied to austenitic stainless steels provides for recrystallization and grain refinement of the centrifugally cast material grain structure. NONFERROUS PIPE-MAKING PROCESSES Aluminum and Aluminum Alloy Tube and Pipe Aluminum tubular products include both pipe and tube. They are hollow-wrought products produced from a hollowed ingot by either extrusion or by welding flat sheet, or skelp, to a cylindrical form. General applications are available in alloys 1100, 2014, 2024, 3003, 5050, 5086, 6061, 6063, and 7075. For shell and tube heat exchanger applications, alloys 1060, 3003, 5052, 5454, and 6061 are available. Pipe is available only in alloys 3003, 6061, and 6063. The designation numbers indicate the particular alloying element contained in the aluminum alloy (such as copper, manganese, silicon, magnesium, and zinc) and the control of the impurities. The numerical designation system consists of four numbers, abcd, where a designates the major alloying element in the aluminum alloy: 1 for 99 percent pure aluminum, 2 for copper, 3 for manganese, 4 for silicon, 5 for magnesium, 6 for magnesium and silicon, 7 for zinc, and 8 for another element. Digit b designates an alloy modification for groups 2 through 8 and an impurity limit for group 1. Digits c and d indicate the specific alloy for groups 2 through 8 and the purity of group 1. Copper and Copper Alloy Tube and Pipe Copper tube and pipe have a wide range of application throughout the chemical, process, automotive, marine, food and beverage, and construction industries. Uni- fied Numbering System (UNS) designations (CXXXXX) have been established for many alloys of copper. ASTM and ASME specifications have been developed for copper tube and pipe. Seamless pipe and tube are covered by ASTM B466, B315, B188, B42, B302, B75, B135, B68, B360, B11, B395, B280, B306, B251, B372, and B88. ASME specifications include SB466, SB315, SB75, SB135, SB111, SB395, and SB359.

A.256 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Tubes and pipe of copper and copper alloys are produced by either of two processes—piercing and extrusion, or welding skelp formed into cylindrical shape. The seamless pipe or tube produced through the extrusion process is the most common commercial form of copper and copper alloy tubular products. Hot Piercing Process. In the Mannesmann piercing process, a heated copper billet is first pierced, then rolled over a mandrel which determines the inside diameter of the pipe. Following the piercing operation, the pierced shell is drawn through a die and over a plug to obtain the finished outside and inside diameters. Extrusion Process. In the extrusion process, the heated copper or copper alloy billets are formed into shells by heavy hydraulic presses. The hollowed-out billet is then extruded through a die and over a mandrel to form the outside and inside diameters of the pipe. Cold-Drawing Process. The cold-drawing process uses mother pipe which is placed on a draw bench which pulls a cold tube through one or a multiplicity of dies and over a mandrel to reduce the pipe gradually to its finished dimensions. Other Processes. Other processes of significance are the cup-and-draw process for large-diameter pipe and the tube-rolling process which reduces copper tubing by means of cold-working over a mandrel with oscillating tapered dies. Nickel and Nickel-Alloy Pipe and Tube Nickel and nickel-alloy pipe and tube, because of their high strength and generally good resistance to oxidation and corrosion, are used in the chemical industry and in steam-generation equipment for nuclear power-generation plants. Applications of nickel are found in tubes and pipe of pure nickel and binary and tertiary alloys of nickel, such as Ni-Cu (Monel 400 and Monel K-500), Ni-Mo and Ni-Si (Hastelloy B), Ni-Cr-Fe (Inconel 600 and Inconel 800), and Ni-Cr-Mo (Hastelloy C276 and Inconel 625) alloys. The alloys are used in applications requiring corrosion resistance to water, acids, alkalis, salts, fluorides, chlorides, and hydrogen chloride. The alloy must be carefully selected to provide for resistance to the specific corrosion media found in the environment. Nickel and nickel-alloy pipe and tube are produced by the Ugine-Sejournet extrusion process, in which a shell is formed by hydraulic piercing of a billet by a ram and subsequent extrusion. Alternately, the billet may be initially pierced by means of drilling. Titanium and Titanium-Alloy Tube and Pipe Titanium and its alloys have provided the engineering designer with an important alternative to aluminum. They are lightweight and have high strength at moderately elevated temperatures, good toughness, and excellent corrosion resistance. Their applications have been found in a wide range of industries, including aerospace, heat-exchange equipment, chemical plants, and power-generation facilities. There is a wide range of alloying systems to which titanium may be produced. The alloying elements possibly include aluminum, molybdenum, nickel, tin, manganese,

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.257 chromium, and vanadium. UNS numbers are used to identify the many available alloys and forms of titanium. Titanium and alloys of titanium pipe and tube are produced from a melt of raw titanium ‘‘sponge’’ and alloying metals in a vacuum electric arc furnace. An ingot is obtained which is reduced to a billet. The billet provides the stock for the extrusion process, from which the tube or pipe is formed. The process consists of initially piercing the billet, then passing a heated shell through a die and over a mandrel. COMMERCIAL PIPE AND TUBE SIZES The standard pipe sizes and other pipe properties are given in App. E2 and E2M, and the standard tube sizes and other tube properties are given in App. E3 and E3M. TUBULAR PRODUCT CLASSIFICATION Pipe and tubing are considered to be separate products, although geometrically they are quite similar. ‘‘Tubular products’’ infers cylindrical products which are hollow, and the classification of ‘‘pipe’’ or ‘‘tube’’ is determined by the end use. Piping Classification Tubular products called pipe include standard pipe, conduit pipe, piling pipe, trans- mission (line) pipe, water-main pipe, oil country tubular goods (pipe), water-well pipe, and pressure pipe. Standard pipe, available in ERW or seamless, is produced in three weight (wall-thickness) classifications: standard, extra strong, and double extra strong (either seamless or welded). ASTM and the American Petroleum Institute (API) provide specifications for the many categories of pipe according to the end use. Other classifications within the end use categorization refer to the method of manufacture of the pipe or tube, such as seamless, cast, and electric resistance welded. Pipe and tube designations may also indicate the method of final finishing, such as hot finished and cold finished. Tubing Classification Pressure tubes are differentiated from pressure pipe in that they are used in exter- nally fired applications while carrying pressurized fluid inside the tube. Structural tubing is used for general structural purposes related to the construc- tion industry. ASTM provides specifications for this type of tubing. Mechanical tubing is produced to meet particular dimensional, chemical, and mechanical property and finish specifications which are a function of the end use, such as machinery and automotive parts. This category of tubing is available in welded (ERW) and seamless form.

A.258 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS SPECIALTY TUBULAR PRODUCTS There are many specialty tubular products designed for special applications requir- ing unique manufacturing methods for production. Examples are the rifled boiler tube, the finned heat-exchanger tube, the duplex tube, and the double-wall tube. FIGURE A5.10 Single rifled boiler tube. The rifled boiler tube (Fig. A5.10) is used to provide an improved heat transfer surface on the inner surface of a boiler tube. The rifling twist, similar to that of a rifle, is produced by specially shaped mandrels over which the tube is drawn. The finned heat exchanger (Fig. A5.11) tube provides improvement in thermal efficiency by providing an extended surface from the base tube surface. The extended surface is produced by turning the tube through special sets of dies which raise fins from part of the base tube material. These fins can be coarse or fine depending on the equipment developed for producing fins. Duplex or composite tubes have been developed to provide a different material on the inside and outside of the tube to meet the requirements of a different environment on either side of the tube. One method of producing a composite tube is by providing a bimetal mother tube before the extrusion or drawing process. Careful development of this process will yield a composite tube with an excellent bond between the two materials. FIGURE A5.11 Finned heat-exchanger tube.

MANUFACTURING OF METALLIC PIPE A.259 FIGURE A5.12 Double-wall leak-detecting tube. Double-wall tubes (Fig. A5.12) are used in applications requiring leak detection to avoid a catastrophic mixture of the fluids on either side of the tube. An inert detecting gas can be placed in the annulus between the two tubes to sense very small amounts of leakage from either tube so as to allow careful shutdown of the system. This tube is manufactured by inserting one tube inside the other, then drawing the combined tube through dies or over mandrels which provide a calibrated prestress between the two tubes. This type of tube was developed for application to a fast breeder reactor sodium-water steam generator. ENGINEERING SELECTION OF PIPE MANUFACTURING METHODS The selection of the appropriate pipe manufacturing method by the design engi- neering specification deserves consideration. For many applications, the codes and standards specified in the procurement contract provide for little room to select an optimal manufacturing method. The safest procedure is to obtain the price and schedule from suppliers before firming the piping specifications. At times the selec- tion of the pipe with the best manufacturing process might be tempered by project cost or delivery considerations. In such cases, much is required of the engineer to consider whether lesser quality will be able to meet the desired reliability standard. It therefore is essential that the engineer is aware of the alternates and their operating history of success and failure before an appropriate alternative decision can be accepted. It must also be recognized that choices based on economic consider- ations alone may prove to be the more costly in the face of the downtime costs of failure.

CHAPTER A6 FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS Edward F. Gerwin, P.E. ASME Fellow INTRODUCTION Background The term fabrication applies to the cutting, bending, forming, and welding of individ- ual pipe components to each other and their subsequent heat treatment and nonde- structive examination (NDE) to form a unit (piping subassembly) for installation. The term installation refers to the physical placement of piping subassemblics, valves, and other specialty items in their required final location relative to pumps, heat exchangers, turbines, boilers, and other equipment; assembly thereto by weld- ing or mechanical methods; final NDE; heat treatment; leak testing; and cleaning and flushing of the completed installation. Depending on the economics of the particular situation, fabrication may be accomplished in a commercial pipe fabrication shop, or a site fabrication shop, where portions of the piping system are fabricated into subassemblies or modules for transfer to the location of the final installation. Commercial pipe shops have specialized equipment for bending and heat treat- ment which is not normally available at installation sites. They also have certain types of automatic welding equipment which permits welding to be performed more efficiently and economically than in field locations where fixed position, manual arc welding is most often employed. As a general rule piping NPS 2¹⁄₂ (DN 65) and larger for nuclear and fossil power plants, chemical plants, refineries, industrial plants, resource recovery, and cogeneration units are most often shop fabricated. Piping NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller is often shop fabricated where special heat treatment or cleaning practices may be required; otherwise it is field fabricated. Pipelines and other systems involv- ing long runs of essentially straight pipe sections welded together are usually field assembled. In recent years, the infusion of new bending technologies, new welding processes, A.261

A.262 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS new alloys, fracture toughness limitations, and mandatory quality assurance (QA) programs have made piping fabrication and installation much more complex than in the past. Greater emphasis is being placed on written procedures for QA and quality control (QC) programs, special processes, and qualification and certification of procedures and personnel. Improper selection of fabrication or installation practices can result in a system which will not function properly or will fail before its expected life span. Accordingly, fabrication and installation contractors must work closely with the designer and be aware of the mandatory requirements of the applicable codes, the unique require- ments and limitations of the materials, and those of the fabrication and installation techniques being applied. Codes and Standards Considerations A great many codes and standards apply to piping. These are discussed in detail in Chap. A4. It is incumbent on the fabricator and/or installer to be familiar with the details of these codes and standards since some codes have the force of law. As an example, the ASME B31.1 Power Piping Code1 is referenced by ASME Section I Power Boilers2 for piping classed as Boiler External Piping. The latter, which is law in most states and Canadian provinces, contains rules for code stamping, data reports, and third-party inspection. Piping under ASME Section III3 also has legal standing. Most other piping codes are used for contractual agreements. Most codes reference ASME Section V4 for nondestructive examination method- ology and ASME Section IX5 for welding requirements. Each of the codes covers a different piping application, and each has evolved in a different way over the years. For specific practices, some have mandatory requirements, while others only have recommendations. Heat treatment require- ments may vary from one to another. The manner in which the code-writing bodies have perceived the hazardous nature of different applications has led to differing NDE requirements. Generally, the codes are reasonably similar, but the owner, designer, fabricator, and installer must meet the specifics of the applicable code to ensure a satisfactory installation. It is essential that the designer be very familiar with the code being used and that purchasing specifications for material, fabrication, and installation be very specific. Reference to the code alone is not sufficient. In the design, a particular allowable stress for a specific material, grade, type, product form, and/ or heat-treated condition was selected. The specifications issued for material pur- chase and fabrication must reflect these specifies to assure that the proper materials and fabrication practices are used. As an example: Type 304 stainless steel has a specified carbon content of 0.08 percent maximum. There is no specified minimum. Footnotes in the B31.1 Code Allowable Stress Tables for Type 304 indicate that for use over 1000�F (538�C), the allowable stresses apply only when the carbon content is 0.04 percent or higher. It is essential that this requirement be put in the purchasing specification if the design temperature exceeds 1000�F (538�C). Similarly, in the B31.1 Code, low chrome alloy electric fusion welded pipe has differing allowable stresses depending upon whether the plate from which it was made was annealed or normalized and tempered. If this material is to be heated above the lower critical temperature during fabrication by hot bending or forming, the designer should specify a postbending heat treatment appropriate for the allow- able stress level used in the design.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.263 It is also incumbent upon the fabricator and/or installer to be very familiar with the applicable code. Each project should be reviewed in detail. ‘‘Standard shop practices’’ may not always produce the desired result. Communication between the designer, fabricator, and installer is essential. All should be familiar with the various standards used in piping design. Most piping systems are composed of items which conform to some dimensional standards such as ASME B36.10M6 and ASME B36.19M for pipe, B16.57 for flanges, etc. Other dimensional standards are issued by the Manufacturers Standardization Society (MSS)8 and the American Petroleum Institute (API).9 The Pipe Fabrication Institute (PFI)10 publishes a series of Engineering Standards which outline suggested practices for various fabrication processes. These standards give excellent guidance for many aspects of piping fabrication not covered by the codes. The American Welding Society (AWS)11 publishes a number of recommended practices for welding of pipe in various materials. Materials Considerations Piping systems are fabricated from a great variety of metals and nonmetals, material selection being a function of the environment and service conditions. Materials must conform to the standards and specifications outlined in the governing code. Some codes such as ASME Section III impose additional requirements on materials beyond those in the material specifications. All fabrication and installation practices applied to these materials must be conducted so as to assure that the final installation exhibits all of the properties implicit in the design. For example, hot bending of certain austenitic stainless steels in the sensitization range will reduce their corrosion resistance if they are not subsequently heat-treated. Accordingly, a heat treatment to restore these properties should be specified. Consideration must also be given to the various types of piping products, their tolerances, alloys, heat-treated conditions, weldability, and formability. Pipe is made by a variety of processes and depending on the method of manufacture can have differing tolerances. Most product forms also come in a variety of alloys, and the choice of a fabrication process may be governed by the alloy. ASME Section IX has developed a system of P Numbers and Group Numbers. This system groups material specifications by chemical composition and/or physical properties. Those with like compositions and properties are grouped together to minimize the number of welding procedure qualifications required. This method of grouping can also be applied to other fabrica- tion processes as well. FABRICATION Drawings Installation Drawings. Current industry practice is for the designer to prepare plans and sections or isometric drawings of the required piping system. These, together with line specifications, outline all the requirements needed for the fabrica- tion and installation. Usually the weld bevel requirements for field welds are speci- fied to assure compatibility between all the system components to be field welded.

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.264 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Frequently the shop welding bevels are left to the discretion of the fabricator, provided, of course, the required weld quality is attainable. Location and numbers of field welds are an economic consideration of available pipe lengths, shipping or heat-treating limitations, and field installation limitations. Shop Details. A piping system prefabricated at a commercial pipe fabrication shop is usually divided into subassemblies or spools. The manner in which a system is divided depends on many factors: available lengths of straight pipe, dimensional and weight limitations for shipping and heat treatment, field welding clearance requirements, and sometimes scheduling needs. Bending, forging, special heat treatment, cleaning, and as much welding as possible are normally performed in the shop. Every attempt is made to minimize the number of field welds, but this must be balanced economically against the added costs of transportation and greater field rigging problems because of larger, heavier, more complex assemblies. Where the site conditions are adverse to normal field erection practices, much of the plant can be fabricated in modules for minimal onsite installation work. Once the number and locations of field welds have been decided, the fabricator will prepare detailed drawings of each subassembly. Each subassembly drawing will show the required configuration; all necessary dimensions required for fabrication; reference to auxiliary drawings or sketches; size, wall thickness, length, alloy, and identification of the materials required; code and classification; reference to special forming, welding, heat treatment, NDE, and cleaning requirements; need for third-party inspection; weight and piece identifica- tion number. See Fig. A6.1. Tolerances. In order to assure installation of a system within a reasonable degree of accuracy, all the components involved must be fabricated to some set of tolerances on those dimensions which affect the system length. Tolerances on valve dimensions are given in B16.34,12 those of welding fittings in B16.9,13 and those for flanges and flanged fittings in B16.5, B16.1,14 etc. The assembly of these components will result in ‘‘tolerance stack-up,’’ which could have a significant impact on the overall dimen- sions, particularly in a closely coupled system. Piping subassembly tolerances normally conform to PFI-ES-3 ‘‘Fabricating Tol- erances.’’15 Usually the terminal dimensions are held to �¹⁄₈ in, but can be held more closely upon agreement with the fabricator. In order to assure that tolerance stack-up is held to a minimum, the manner in which shop details are dimensioned should be carefully studied. As an example, assemblies with multiple nozzles can result in large deviations if these are dimen- sioned center to center. A better way is to select a base point and dimension all nozzles from this location. This assures that all nozzles are �¹⁄₈ in (3.0 mm) from the base point. See Fig. A6.2. For angle bends, terminal dimensions and often a chord dimension are required, since a small variation in angle with long ends can result in serious misalignment. See Fig. A6.3. Sometimes assemblies which have been fabricated within tolerance may not fit in the field because of tolerance stack-ups on equipment to which they are attached. This will be addressed in the section, ‘‘Installation.’’ Procedures and Travelers. The need to assure better control of fabrication pro- cesses has led the use of written procedures for most operations. Fabricators will have a library of written procedures controlling cutting, welding, bending, heat treatment, nondestructive examination, and testing. Welding procedures in most

A.266 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A6.2 Dimensioning. codes are qualified under ASME Section IX, which requires written Welding Proce- dure Specifications (WPSs) backed up by Procedure Qualification Records (PQRs). Similarly ASME Section V requires NDE to be performed to written procedures. Frequently, piping fabricators use a system of travelers to control flow through the shop. This practice is well-suited to fabrication of piping subassemblies under QA or QC programs, where record keeping is required. It also affords the purchaser and the third-party inspector opportunities for establishing ‘‘hold points’’ where they may wish to witness certain operations or review certain records. Fabrication Practices Cutting and Beveling. The methods of cutting plate or pipe to length can be classed as mechanical or thermal. Mechanical methods involve the use of saws, abrasive discs, lathes, and pipe- cutting machines or tools. See Fig. A6.4. Thermal methods are oxyfuel gas cutting or electric arc cutting. Oxyfuel gas cutting is a process wherein severing of the metal is effected by the chemical reaction of the base metal with oxygen at an elevated temperature. In the cutting torch, a fuel such as acetylene, propane, or natural gas is used to preheat the base metal to cutting temperature. A high-velocity stream of oxygen is then directed at the heated area resulting in an exothermic reaction and severing of the material. Oxyfuel gas cutting is widely used for cutting carbon steels and low alloys. It does, however, lose its effectiveness with increasing alloy content. For higher alloy materials, some form of arc cutting is required. Plasma arc cutting is the process most frequently employed. It involves an extremely high temperature (30,000 to 50,000�K), a constricted arc, and a high-velocity gas. The torch generates an arc which is forced to pass through a small-diameter orifice and concentrate its energy on a small area to melt the metal. At the same time a gas such as argon, hydrogen, or a nitrogen-hydrogen mixture is also introduced at the orifice where it expands and is accelerated through the orifice. The melted metal is removed by the jetlike action of the gas stream.

A.268 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A6.4 Pipe-cutting machine. (Pullman Power Products Corporation) Because oxyfuel gas and arc cutting involve the application of heat, preheating may be advisable in some cases. A very detailed description of oxyfuel gas and arc cutting is presented in The Welding Handbook.16 Weld end bevels can also be prepared by the mechanical or thermal methods just described. Both mechanical and thermal methods are used to apply the V bevel, which is used in the vast majority of piping applications. For compound and U bevels or those which may involve a counterboring requirement, horizontal boring mills are most appropriate. Various factors to be considered in selecting a weld end bevel are discussed in the section, ‘‘Welding Joint Design.’’ Forming. The term forming as it relates to piping fabrication encompasses bend- ing, extruding, swaging, lapping, and expanding. All of these operations entail the use of equipment normally only available in pipe fabrication shops. Although the availability of welding fittings in the form of elbows, tees, reducers, and lapped- joint stub ends may reduce the need for certain of these operations, economics may dictate their use, especially where special pipe sizes are involved. Bending Economics. The use of bends versus welding fittings for changes in direction should be carefully evaluated from an economic viewpoint. Bends whose radii range from 3 to 5 times the nominal pipe diameter will offer the least pressure drop while still affording adequate flexibility to the system. Since each bend eliminates a welding fitting and at least one weld with its attendant examination, bending is very often the economic choice. In the case of special pipe sizes which are frequently used for main steam, reheat, and feedwater lines in large central power generating units, bending may be the only option available.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.269 Limitations. The metal being bent should preferably exhibit good ductility and a low rate of strain hardening. Most metals used in piping systems fulfill these requirements. A successful bend is also a function of its diameter, thickness, and bending radius. As the diameter-to-thickness ratio increases and the bending radius decreases, there is greater probability of flattening and buckling. Each bending process has differing capabilities, so the selection of a bending process rests on the availability of equipment and/or practices capable of handling the material, diame- ter, thickness, and bending radius involved. Accept and Reject Criteria. The codes have certain requirements for the accept- ability of finished bends: 1. Thinning: In every bending operation the outer portion of the bend (extrados) stretches and the inner portion (intrados) compresses. This results in a thinning of the extrados and a thickening of the intrados. Because of uncertainties introduced by the pipe-manufacturing method, by the pipe tolerances, and by those introduced by the pipe-bending operation itself, it is not possible to exactly predetermine the degree of thinning. However, it can be approximated by multiplying the thickness before bending by the ratio: where r �the radius of the pipe (¹⁄₂ the outside diameter) R �the radius of the bend The codes require that the wall thick- ness at the extrados after bending be at least equal to the minimum wall thick- ness required for straight pipe. Accord- ingly, the fabricator must assure that the wall thickness ordered has sufficient margin for this effect. Although the codes do not comment on the resulting increased thickness of the intrados, this thickness does serve to offset a portion of the increased stresses caused by internal pressure which are found at this location. (See Theory and Design of Modern Pressure Vessels.17) 2. Ovality: A second acceptance cri- teria is ovality. During the bending oper- ation, the cross section of the bend arc frequently assumes an oval shape whose major axis is perpendicular to the plane of the bend. See Fig. A6.5. The degree of ovality is determined by the difference between the major and minor axes di- vided by the nominal diameter of the pipe. FIGURE A6.5 Bend ovality. Where the bend is subject to internal pressure, the pressure tries to reround the cross section by creating secondary stresses in the hoop direction. Some codes consider an ovality of 8 percent acceptable in this case. Where the bend is subject to external pressure, the pressure tries to

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.270 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS collapse the cross section. The ASME B31.3 Code18 recommends a 3 percent maxi- mum ovality when the bend is subject to external pressure. 3. Buckling: Bending of pipe with large diameter-to-thickness ratios often results in buckling rather than thickening of the intrados, even where internal mandrels or other devices are employed to minimize it. The codes do not address this subject. It is, however, often the subject of ‘‘good workmanship’’ debates. The PFI gives a criterion which has been generally accepted. This appears in PFI ES-24.19 An accept- able buckle is one where the ratio of the distance between two crests divided by the depth of the average crest to valley is equal to or greater than 12. See Fig. A6.6 FIGURE A6.6 Suggested pipe buckling tolerance. (Pipe Fabrication Institute PFI ES-24) Bending Methods. Pipe is bent by a variety of methods, using bending tables or bending machines, with and without the application of heat. The selection of one method over another is a function of economics, materials properties, pipe size, bending radius, and equipment availability. The arc length of the bend may be heated in order to reduce the yield strength of the material. Higher bending temperatures result in lowering the yield strength and reduction of the bending energy required. Cold bending normally infers bending at ambient temperature, while hot bending infers the application of heat. However, definitions given in B31.1 and ASME Section III create an exception to this for ferritic materials. These codes define cold bending of ferritic steels as any operation where the bending is performed at a temperature 100�F (55�C) below the lower critical or lower. Ferritic materials un- dergo a phase change on heating and cooling. On heating, this change starts at a temperature called the lower critical. (See Heat Treatment—Ferritic Steels).

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.271 Ferrous Pipe and Tubes 1. Cold bending: Where sufficient quantities of repetitive bends are required, ferrous pipes and tubes up to NPS 10 or 12 (DN 250 or 300) with wall thickness of ¹⁄₂ in (12.7 mm) or less are most often bent at ambient temperature using some type of bending machine. There are a great variety of cold bending machines available, with degrees of sophistication varying from simple manually operated single-plane bending devices to numerically controlled hydraulically operated machines capable of multiplane bends. In ram-type bending, two pressure dies which are free to rotate are mounted in a fixed position on the machine frame. The pipe to be bent is positioned against these dies. A ram then presses a forming die against the pipe and the pressure dies wipe the pipe around the forming die. See Fig. A6.7. Ram bending is usually applied to heavier wall thicknesses. FIGURE A6.7 Ram bender. In compression bending the pipe is clamped to a stationary bending die and wiped around it by a follower. As in all bends, the extrados thins and the intrados thickens or compresses. The degree of compression is greater than the thinning in this method. Compression bending is usually limited to heavier walls and larger bending radii. See Fig. A6.8 to compare compression and draw bending. In rotary draw bending the pipe is clamped to a rotating bending form and drawn past a pressure die which is usually fixed. See Fig. A6.9. The degree of thinning of the extrados is greater than the compression of the intrados. This method permits bending of thinner wall pipe and tubes at smaller bending radii. To accommodate lighter walls and tighter radii it is often advisable to provide internal support to minimize flattening or buckling. Usually this takes the form of an internal mandrel. As the diameter-to-thickness ratio increases and the bending radius decreases, mandrels using follower balls are employed. See Fig. A6.10. Roll bending is often used for coiling. One of its great advantages is that the bending radius is not dependent on a fixed radius die, and consequently there is great flexibility in choosing a bending radius. In roll bending three power-driven rolls, usually in pyramid form, are used. The pipe to be bent is placed between the

Bending is accomplished by adjusting the rolls relative to each other as necessary to attain the required diameter. See Fig. A6.11. Pipe can also be cold bent on a bending table in the manner described for hot bending below, except that for ferritic materials the bending temperature is kept at least 100�F (56�C) below the lower critical. A postbending heat treatment for cold bends may be advisable for some alloys, degree of deformation, certain service conditions, or when mandated by code. 2.

For hot bending of ferrous materials the pipe to be bent is usually heated to tempera- tures in the range of 1750 to 2050�F (954 to 1121�C). For austenitic materials these temperatures may introduce sensi- tization, and for ferritic materials they will exceed the critical temperature where metallurgical phase changes oc- FIGURE A6.11 Operating essentials in one cur. See the section ‘‘Heat Treatment’’ method of three-roll bending. (Metals for a discussion of these subjects. Handbook20) The traditional method of hot bend- ing is performed on a bending table. De- pending on the diameter-to-thickness ratio, the pipe to be bent may be packed with sand to provide more rigidity and thus reduce the tendency for buckling. A rule of thumb is to sand fill if the diameter-to-thickness ratio is 10 to 1 or greater for 5-diameter bends. However, when the diameter-to-thickness ratio approaches 30 to 1, sand begins to lose its effectiveness, and buckles will appear. As the diameter of the pipe increases, the probability of buckling will increase since the sand fill will not expand in proportion to the pipe, leaving a void between the pipe and packing. It becomes pronounced around NPS 24 (DN 600). After the pipe has been packed with sand, it is placed in a specially designed bending furnace. The furnace is usually gas fired through ports along its length, placed to direct the flames around the pipe and avoid direct flame impingement. The furnace is controlled by thermocouples or pyrometers to assure that the required bending temperature is attained but not exceeded. Depending on the length of arc to be bent, it may be necessary to make the bend in more than one heat. After the segment to be bent has attained the required temperature throughout its thickness, the pipe is placed on the bending table. One end is restrained by holding pins and the other is pulled around by block and tackle powered by a winch. As bending progresses, the arc is checked against a bending template. Reposi-

For ferritic steels, it is recommended that the bending be completed above the upper critical temperature of the metal, usually about 1600 to 1725�F (870 to 940�C). There are certain limits as to the combination of diameters, thicknesses, and bending radii which can be accommodated by the hot table bend method. PFI Standard ES-24 contains a chart of suggested limits for bend radius versus diameter to wall thickness ratios. See Fig. A6.13. To fulfill the need for a bending process beyond the capabilities of hot table bending, the M. W. Kellogg Co. developed the increment bending process, which was further refined by Pullman Power Products Corp. In this process, one end of the pipe is fixed in an anchor box while a clamp connected to a hydraulic piston is attached to the other. A gas torch ring burner assembly is positioned at one end of the arc to be bent. The burner assembly is sized to heat a length of arc (increment) about 1 to 2 times the pipe wall thickness. The increment length is selected to be less than the buckling wave length of the pipe. The increment is then heated to bending temperature. Optical pyrometers are used to control the heating to assure that proper temperature is attained but not exceeded. At bending temperature the hydraulic piston pulls the clamped end a fixed amount to bend the heated increment. The increment is then water cooled, the torch ring moved to the next increment, and the process is repeated. As many as 350 increments may be required for a typical NPS 24 �³⁄₈-in (DN 600 �9.5 mm), 90�, 5-diameter bend. The process can produce bends in sizes from NPS 8 to 48 (DN 200 to 1200) with bending radii of 3 pipe diameters and larger in ferrous and nickel-alloy materi- als. Because the heat is applied from one side only, thicknesses are limited to 2 in (50 mm) and less. In more recent years a more sophisticated piece of bending equipment has entered the pipe-bending field, notably the Induction Bender. In this process the increment to be bent is heated by an induction coil, and the bending operation is continuous. The pipe to be bent is inserted in the machine, and the start of the arc

The portion of the pipe upstream of the coil is clamped to a rotating arm fixed to the required bend radius. The downstream portion of the pipe is pushed hydraulically through the coil, where it attains bending temperature. Since it is clamped to the rotating arm, a bending moment is imposed on the pipe and it bends as it moves through the coil. As soon as it has been bent, the heated section is cooled to restore its prior rigidity. The permissible rate of cooling is a function of material composition. Low-carbon steels and some low Cr molys may be water quenched. It is recommended that the 9Cr-1Mo-V material be cooled in still air. The Induction Bender is manufactured in several sizes depending on the expected combinations of pipe size and bending radius. These range from NPS 3¹⁄₂ to 64 (DN 80 to 1600) and from 8 to 400 in (DN 200 to 10,000 mm) in radius. Since induction is used as the heating method, wall thicknesses as heavy as 4 in (100 mm) can be bent. (See Fig. A6.14a and 6.14b.) 3. Nonferrous pipe and tubes: Although most of the equipment used to bend ferrous materials is also used for bending nonferrous materials, the details of bending do differ from those for ferrous materials and also vary between the several nonfer- rous materials themselves. Accordingly, it is wise to obtain specific procedural information from the materials’ producers or from other reliable sources such as the latest edition of The Metals Handbook.20 Certain nonferrous materials can be hot bent. Aluminum and aluminum alloys can be bent cold using the same types of bending equipment used for ferrous materials. Alloys in the annealed condition are easiest to bend, but care is required in selecting tooling because of the low tensile strength and high ductility of these materials. Alloys with higher tempers and heat-treatable alloys require larger bending radii for satisfactory results. It is seldom necessary to

More detailed information is available from the manufac- turers of aluminum products. Copper and copper alloy pipe and tube can be readily bent to relatively small radii. Although copper can be bent hot, the vast majority is done cold. For draw bending an internal mandrel is required and for other methods internal support is recommended. For very tight radii a snug-fitting forming block and shoe which practically surround the pipe at the point of bending are needed to preclude buckling. Hot bending of copper and copper alloys particularly in larger diameters and walls is common. Pipes are usually sand-filled, and contoured bending dies are recommended. See Table A6.1. More information can be obtained from the Copper Development Association.21 Nickel and nickel-alloy pipe can be cold bent with the same type of bending equipment used for ferrous materials. Use of material in the annealed condition is preferred. For bends with radii 6 diameters and less, filler material or internal mandrels are required. Draw bending with internal mandrels is the preferred method for close-radius bending. Galling can become a problem, and chromium-plated or hard bronze-alloy mandrels should be used. Nickel and nickel alloys can be hot bent using the same practices as for ferrous steels. Sand filling is appropriate. Care should be taken to assure that the sand and heating fuel are low in sulfur and that any marking paints or crayons or lubricants have been removed. These materials can be bent over a wide temperature range. See Table A6.2. The best bending is usually between 1850 and 2100�F (1010 to 1149�C). Other nickel alloys may exhibit carbide precipitation and should not be worked in the sensitization range. Postbending heat treatment may be required. For more information contact nickel product manufacturers such as Huntington Alloys.22 Titanium can be bent using draw bending equipment. However, those parts of the equipment which will wipe against the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe should be of aluminum bronze to minimize galling. For better formability, the pipe, the pressure die, and the mandrel should be heated to a temperature between 350 and 400�F (177 and 204�C). Unalloyed titanium can be hot worked in the tempera- ture range of 1000 to 1400�F (538 to 760�C). Titanium alloy grade 12 requires a temperature range of 1400 to 1450�F (760 to 788�C). Heat treatment of titanium is recommended after forming. This is usually a furnace treatment at 1000 to 1100�F (538 to 593�C) for a minimum of ¹⁄₂ h for the unalloyed grades and 1 h for the alloy

(grade 12). Prolonged exposure to temperatures in excess of 1100�F (593�C) will result in heavy scaling and require some type of descaling treatment. Other Forming Operations. Some additional forming operations which can be performed in a pipe shop are extrusion, swaging, and lapping. Extrusions involve forming outlets in pipe by pulling or pushing a hemispherical or conical die from the inside of the pipe through an opening in the wall. The work may be done hot or cold depending on the characteristics of the material. Ferritic steels, austenitic steels, and nickel alloys are usually formed hot; aluminum and copper are usually formed cold. In order to assure that the outlet will have sufficient reinforcement, it is necessary to increase the wall thickness of the header as a function of the outlet size desired. An increase of 30 percent may be needed for large outlet-to- header ratios. Swaging involves the size reduction of pipe ends by forging, pressing, or rolling operations. The operation is usually used to produce reductions of one to two pipe sizes. Ferritic steels, austenitic steels, and nickel alloys are usually formed hot. Aluminum and copper are formed cold. In lapped joints, a loose flange is slipped over the end of the pipe which is then heated to forging temperature, upset, and flared at right angles to the pipe axis. After heat treatment and cooling, the lapped section is machined on the face to attain a good gasket surface and on the back for good contact with the flange. The finished thickness of the lapped flange should be equal to or exceed the thickness of the pipe. Layout, Assembly, and Preparation for Welding. In fabrication shops, piping subassemblies are often assembled on layout tables. A projection of the subassembly is laid out on the table in chalk. This establishes the baseline for locating the components and terminal dimensions of the subassembly, and the components are assembled relative to the layout. Prior to fit-up, it is essential that all weld surfaces be properly cleaned of rust, scale, grease, paint, and other foreign substances which might contaminate the weld. If moisture is present, the weld joint should be pre- heated. For alloy steels the heat-affected zone (HAZ) which results from thermal cutting should be removed by grinding or machining. Depending on the configuration of the subassembly and root opening required by the welding procedure, some allowance may be required for weld shrinkage in the longitudinal direction. Actual shrinkage is difficult to predict and can vary considerably because of the many variables involved. For most open butt and backing ring joints, one-half the root opening is a reasonable allowance. For joints

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.279 with other root configurations it may be as little as ¹⁄₁₆ in (2.0 mm) for the lighter walls, increasing to as much as ⁵⁄₃₂ in (8 mm) for walls 4 to 5 in (100 to 127 mm) thick. Each weld joint should be carefully aligned within required tolerances using alignment fixtures, spacers, or jigs if necessary. Poor alignment may result in a poor weld. Once alignment is attained, the joint is usually tack-welded to maintain the alignment. The process used for tacking is usually that being used for the root-pass weld. Numbers and size of tacks should be kept to a minimum, but if the subassembly is to be moved elsewhere for weld out, their size must be sufficiently large so as not to crack during the moving operation. Temporary lugs or spacer bars may also be used for this purpose provided they are of a compatible material, the temporary welds are removed, and the surface examined after removal to assure sound metal. Tack welds made by the shielded metal are welding (SMAW) or gas metal arc welding (GMAW) processes at the root of a weld should be removed or ground smooth since they can become a source of lack of fusion. For gas tungsten arc (GTAW) root welds, tacks usually fuse the adjacent lands to each other or to the insert, and filler metal is often not used. Tack welds are then fused into the weld during the root pass without further preparation. After tacking, the recommended practice is to complete the root pass and one or more weld out passes before starting to complete the weld by other processes to avoid burning through the relatively thin root. Welding. Welding constitutes the bulk of the work involved in fabrication of modern piping systems, so it is essential for all involved to have a good working knowledge of this subject. Procedure and Personnel Qualifications. All of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Codes and most of the ASME B31 Pressure Piping Codes reference ASME Section IX for the requirements for qualifying welding procedures and welding personnel. The ASME B31.4,23 B31.8,24 and B31.1125 Codes also permit qualification to API- 1104,26 published by the American Petroleum Institute. ASME B31.527 permits qualification to AWS D10.9.28 The purpose of procedure qualification is to assure that the particular combina- tion of welding process, base metal, filler material, shielding fluxes or gases, electrical characteristics, and subsequent heat treatment is capable of producing a joint with the required chemical and physical characteristics. The purpose of personnel qualification is to assure that the welder or welding machine operator is capable of performing the operation in accordance with a qualified procedure in the required position. Procedure Qualification. ASME Section IX requires the preparation of a Weld- ing Procedure Specification (WPS), which lists the various parameters to be used during welding. When each WPS is qualified, the parameters used in the qualification are recorded in a Procedure Qualification Record (PQR). For each type of welding process, ASME Section IX has established a series of variables. These are base metal, filler metal, position, preheat, postweld heat treatment, shielding gases, joint configuration, electrical characteristics, and tech- nique. Base metal must not only be considered from a chemical and physical properties point of view, but in piping, the diameter and thickness of the test coupon limits the qualification to certain sizes. Differing fluxes, use of solid or gaseous backing, and single- or multipass techniques are some of the other variables which must be considered. Careful study of Section IX, AWS D10.9, or of API 1104 as may be applicable is in order. The variables for welding are classed as essential, supplementary essential, and nonessential. The manner in which the variables are classed can vary depending

A.280 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS on the welding process. That is, what may be classed as an essential variable for one may be a nonessential variable for one another. For a given process, each combination of essential variables must be qualified separately. A change in any one of them requires a new qualification. When welds must meet certain fracture toughness requirements, the supplemen- tary essential variables become essential and the procedure must be requalified for the particular combination of essential and supplementary essential variables. Nonessential variables do not require requalification but should be referenced in the WPS. Personnel Qualification. The fabricator and/or installer must qualify each welder or welding operator for the welding processes to be used during production welding. The performance qualification must be in accordance with a qualified WPS. Each performance qualification is also governed by a series of essential variables which are a function of the welding process for which the welder is being qualified. The welder or welding operator may be qualified by mechanical tests or in some cases by radiographic examination of the test coupon. The record of each performance qualification is kept on a Welder/Welding Operator Performance Qualification (WPQ). Under ASME Section IX rules, a qualified welder who has not welded in a specific process within a specified period of time must be requalified for that process. API 1104 and AWS D10.9 have similar requalification provisions. Welding Processes. Currently the most commonly used welding processes for fabrication of piping are SMAW, submerged arc welding (SAW), GTAW, GMAW, and flux core arc welding (FCAW). Some special applications may involve plasma arc welding (PAW) or electron beam welding (EBW), but their application to piping is still rare. However, any welding process which can be qualified under the requirements of ASME Section IX is acceptable. Detailed descriptions of these various processes and their variations may be found in the Welding Handbook.16 This section will limit discussion to their application to piping. For shop work, the best efficiency in all welding processes is attained when the pipe axis is horizontal and the piece is rotated so that welding is always done in the flat position. This is referred to as the 1G position. Other positions are 2G (pipe vertical and fixed, weld horizontal); 5G (pipe horizontal and fixed, weld a combination of flat, vertical, and overhead); and 6G (pipe inclined at 45�and fixed). See ASME Section IX. Shielded Metal Arc Welding. SMAW has been the mainstay for pipe welding for many years, but it is rapidly being displaced by newer, more efficient processes. It is a process where an arc is manually struck between the work and a flux-coated electrode which is consumed in the weld. The core wire serves as the filler material, and the flux coating disintegrates to provide shielding gases for the molten metal, scavengers, and deoxidizers for the weld puddle and a slag blanket to protect the molten metal until it is sufficiently cool to prevent oxidation. It can be used in all positions, for upward or downward progression, and for root pass welding depending on the flux composition. Each weld pass is about ¹⁄₈ in thick, and before subsequent passes are made the slag must be removed and the surface prepared by removing irregularities which could entrap slag during subsequent passes. Submerged Arc Welding. Unlike SMAW, SAW is an automatic or semiauto- matic process. For circumferential welds in pipe the welding head is fixed for flat welding and the work is rotated under the head (1G position). It is used most efficiently in groove butt welds in heavy wall materials with pipe sizes NPS 6 (DN 150) and larger. The arc is created between the work and a bare solid wire or composite electrode which is consumed during the operation. The electrode comes

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.281 in coils. Shielding is accomplished by a blanket of granular, fusible material called a flux which covers the arc and molten metal by forming a slag blanket to prevent oxidation of the molten metal until it has sufficiently cooled. Particular wire-flux combinations are required to assure that the deposited weld has the needed chemical and physical properties. This process has the greatest deposition rate and accordingly is the preferred process wherever possible. Because of the high heat input, care must be taken to assure that the interpass temperature is controlled to minimize sensitization in austenitic stainless steels or loss of notch toughness in ferritic steels. High heat input can also result in excessive penetration, so this process cannot be used effectively for root pass welding unless the root is deposited against a backing ring or sufficient backing is provided by two or more weld passes made by the shielded metal arc or a gas-shielded arc process. Gas Shielded Arc Welding. The term gas-shielded arc welding applies to those welding processes where the arc and molten metal are shielded from oxidation by some type of inert gas rather than by a flux. 1. Gas tungsten arc welding: GTAW is a form of gas-shielded arc welding where the arc is generated between the work and a tungsten electrode which is not consumed. The filler metal must be added from an external source, usually as bare filler rod or preplaced consumable insert. The filler metal is melted by the heat of the arc, and shielding gases are usually argon or helium. Alloying elements are always in the filler material. GTAW is considered to be the most desirable process for making root welds of highest quality. Techniques using added filler metal or preplaced filler metal as inserts are equally effective in manual and automatic applications. Automatic versions can be used in all positions provided sufficient clearance is available for the equipment. Automatic versions also require tighter fit-up require- ments since the equipment is set to specific parameters and will not recognize variations outside of these limits, such as a welder would do in manual applications. In automatic GTAW, the welding head orbits the weld joint on a guide track placed on the pipe adjacent to the joint to be welded. The welding head contains motors and drive wheels needed to move the head around the track, a torch to create the arc, and a spool of filler wire. Welding current, voltage, travel speed, wire feed rate, and oscillation are controlled from an external source. These parame- ters may be varied by the operator as the welding head traverses the weld. Oscillation and arc energy can be adjusted to permit greater dwell time and heat input into the side walls. Automatic GTAW welds are usually deposited as a series of stringer beads to minimize the effects of high interpass temperature. 2. Gas metal arc welding: GMAW is a type of gas-shielded welding generally used in the manual mode but adaptable to automation. The filler wire is the electrode and is furnished in coils or spools of solid wire. Is is fed automatically into the joint, melted in the arc, and deposited in the weld groove. Alloying elements arc in the wire, and shielding gas may be argon, helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or combinations thereof, depending on the application. Depending on the equipment and the heat input settings, filler metal can be transferred across the arc is several modes. In short-circuiting transfer, the electrode actually touches the work where it short-circuits, melts, and restarts the arc. This process has low heat input and accordingly low penetrating power. It can often result in lack of fusion. Because of the low heat input, however, it can be effectively used for open-butt root pass welding. In spray transfer, the heat input parameters are sufficiently high to transfer the molten electrode across the arc as small droplets. Argon or argon-rich gases are

A.282 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS used for shielding, resulting in a very stable spatterfree arc. Because of the high arc energy, it is normally used in the flat (1G) position. For all-position welding, a procedure which superimposes high amplitude pulses of current on a low-level steady-state current at regular intervals is often used. This results in a discrete transfer of metal with lower heat input needed for all-position welding. 3. Flux core arc welding: FCAW is a variation of GMAW where a composite electrode is substituted for the solid wire. The electrode is a tubular wire containing a flux material. Depending on the application, the arc may be self-shielding, or shielding gases may be used. Because of its high deposition rate this process is rapidly being developed for shop and field welding of piping. Base Metal. Base metal is one of the essential variables for welding qualifica- tion. Because there are so many base metals to be welded, ASME Section IX has established a system of P Numbers and Group Numbers. Each base metal is assigned to a specific P Number depending on characteristics such as composition, weldability, and mechanical properties. Each P Number is further subdivided into Group Num- bers depending on fracture toughness properties. See Table A6.3. When a procedure is qualified with a base metal within a particular P Number, it is also qualified for all other base metals within that P Number. When fracture toughness is a requirement, qualification is limited to base metals within the same P Number and Group Number. For example: A 106 Gr. B pipe is P No. 1 Gr. No. 1, while an A 105 flange is P No. 1 Gr. No. 2. Since both are P No. 1, qualification on either qualifies both when fracture toughness is not a factor. However, should fracture toughness become a requirement, a separate qualification would be required for each to itself and to each other. Filler Metals. Electrodes, bare wire, wire-flux combinations, and consumable inserts which form a part of the finished weld are classed as filler materials. Most are covered by AWS and ASME specifications. See ASME Section II Part C.29 When the filler material is part of the electric circuit, it is designated as an TABLE A6.3 ASME P Numbers and Group Numbers for Some Typical Piping Materials Nominal composition P No. Group No. Carbon Steel—65 ksi & under 1 1 —65 ksi to 75 ksi 1 2 C-¹⁄₂Mo & ¹⁄₂Cr-¹⁄₂ Mo—65 ksi & under 3 1 —70 ksi to 75 ksi 3 2 1Cr-¹⁄₂Mo & 1¹⁄₄Cr-¹⁄₂ Mo-Si 4 1 2¹⁄₄Cr-1Mo 5A 1 5Cr-¹⁄₂Mo, & 9Cr-1Mo 5B 1 9Cr-1Mo-V 5B 2 Type 304 & 316 Stainless 8 1 Type 309 & 310 Stainless 8 2 3¹⁄₂ Ni Steel 9B 1 Al & Al alloys 21 thru 25 — Cu & Cu alloys 31 thru 35 — Ni & Ni alloys 41 thru 47 — Source: Selected from ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code Section IX, 1995 ed.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.283 electrode. If it is fed externally and melted by the heat of the arc, it is designated as a rod. Coated electrodes for SMAW come in straight lengths. Bare rods for GTAW come in straight lengths or spools. Electrode wire for GMAW and SAW are in spools or coils, while composite electrodes for FCAW are in spools. Each specification incorporates a system of identification so that the filler materi- als manufactured by different suppliers which have equivalent characteristics are identified by the same number. For qualification purposes, they are classified in ASME Section IX with F Num- bers and A Numbers. Changes in filler metal from one F Number or A Number to another require requalification. One of the problems associated with coated electrodes for SMAW is the introduc- tion of hydrogen into the arc atmosphere and finished weld, resulting in hydrogen- induced cracking. To minimize this problem, low-hydrogen-type coatings are used, but these can absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Once a sealed can of electrodes is opened, the electrodes should be stored in an oven at about 250 to 350�F (120 to 175�C) or other temperature recommended by the manufacturer. Once removed from the oven, low-hydrogen electrodes should be maintained at 175�F (80�C) minimum until consumed. Baking to remove moisture is recommended for elec- trodes which have been out of the oven for several hours. Refer to the manufacturers’ recommendations. A problem associated with welding of fully austenitic stainless steel is microfis- suring. To combat this problem the chemical composition of the filler material is adjusted to produce a weld deposit with small amounts of ferrite. ASME III requires that filler materials used in welding austenitic stainless steels contain a minimum of 5 percent ferrite. Ferrite, however, can be a problem at cryogenic and high temperatures. For cryogenic services the weld metal may not possess the fracture toughness capabilities of the base metal, and the ferrite content should be kept as low as possible. Alternatively, fully austenitic fillers may be required, but these are more crack-sensitive. For very high temperatures ferrite in the weld may convert to a brittle phase called sigma. For this reason applications over about 800�F (427�C) usually require a minimum of 3 percent ferrite for weldability but not exceeding 7 percent to minimize sigma formation. Preheat and Interpass Temperature. Ferritic materials undergo metallurgical phase changes when cooling from welding to ambient temperature. Mild steels which contain no more than 0.20 percent carbon and 1 percent manganese can be welded without preheat when the thickness is 1 in (25 mm) or less. However, as the chemical composition changes by increases of carbon, manganese, and silicon or the addition of chromium and certain other alloying elements, preheating becomes increasingly important since the higher carbon and chrome molybdenum steels can develop more crack-sensitive martensitic, matensitic-bainitic, and other mixed phase structures when cooled rapidly from welding temperatures. There is also a potential for hydrogen from SMAW electrode coatings or from moisture on the base metal surface to be dissolved in the weld. Also as the weld cools, stresses caused by shrinkage are imposed on the parts and distortion can result; and as thickness increases, thermal shock from the heat of welding can induce cracking more readily. Preheating prior to welding is a solution to most of these problems. Preheating slows the cooling rate of the weld joint and results in a more ductile metallurigical structure in the weld metal and HAZ. It permits dissolved hydrogen to diffuse more readily and helps to reduce shrinkage, distortion, and possible cracking caused by the resultant residual stresses. It raises the temperature of the material sufficiently high to be above the brittle fracture transition zone for most materials. The codes vary regarding preheat requirements. Some have mandatory require-

For example, for carbon steel welding, the B31.1 Code requires preheating to a temperature of 175�F (80�C) when the carbon content exceeds 0.30 percent and the thickness of the joint exceeds 1 in. B31.3 recommends preheating to 175�F (80�C) when the base metal specified strength exceeds 71 ksi or the wall thickness is equal to or greater than 1 in (25 mm). ASME III Section suggests a preheat of 200�F (95�C) when the maximum carbon content is 0.30 percent or less and the wall thickness exceeds 1¹⁄₂ in for P No. 1 Gr. No. 1, or 1 in (25 mm) for P No. 1 Gr. No. 2. It also suggests a 250�F (120�C) preheat for materials with carbon in excess of 0.30 percent and wall thick- nesses exceeding 1 in (25 mm). The ASME B31.4 and B31.8 Codes require preheat based on carbon equivalents. When the carbon content (by ladle analysis) exceeds 0.32 percent, or the carbon equivalent (C �¹⁄₄ Mn) exceeds 0.65 percent, preheating is required. The reader is advised to consult the specific codes for preheating requirements. See Table A6.4 for some typical preheat requirements. It should be noted that for the 9Cr-1Mo-V (P No. 5B Gr. 2) material some manufacturers suggest a preheat of 350�F (177�C) for GTAW and 400 to 450�F (204 to 232�C) for other types of welding regardless of thickness. While it is preferred that preheat be maintained during welding and into the postweld heat treatment cycle without cooling, this may not always be practical. The B31.1 Code permits slow cooling of the weld to room temperature provided the completed weld deposit is a minimum of ³⁄₈ in (9.5 mm) or 25 percent of the final thickness, whichever is less. For P No. 5B and P No. 6 materials some type of intermediate stress relief is required. For the 9Cr-1Mo-V material it is recommended that the finished weld be heated

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.285 to 500�F (260�C), held at that temperature for 2 hours, and allowed to cool slowly in still air by wrapping it with insulating material. Too much heat during welding can also be a problem. Where notch toughness is a requirement, prolonged exposure to temperatures exceeding 600�F (316�C) can temper the base metal. Controlling the interpass temperature is required to minimize this problem. Interpass temperature control means allowing the temperature of the joint to cool below some specified level before the next pass is deposited. Because of its martensitic structure, a maximum interpass temperature of 600�F (316�C) should be observed when welding 9Cr-1Mo-V material. In welding of austenitic stainless steels, sensitization of the base metal HAZ will result from the heat and welding. Here the solution is to weld with as low a heat input as possible at the highest possible speed to minimize the precipitation of carbides (sensitization). A maximum interpass temperature of 300 to 350�F (149 to 177�C) is usually employed. Weld Joint Design Butt Welds. A butt joint is defined as one in which the members being joined are in the same plane. The circumferential butt joint is the most universally used method of joining pipe to itself, fittings, flanges, valves, and other equipment. The type of end preparation may vary depending on the particular preferences of the individual, but in general the bevel shape is governed by a compromise between a root sufficiently wide to assure a full-penetration weld but not so wide as to require a great deal of filler metal. In the shop, the inside surface of large-diameter pipe joints is often accessible. In this case the joint is most often double-welded (welded from both sides), and a double V bevel is used. For heavier walls, machined double U bevels can be used. However, the vast majority of piping butt welds must be made from one side only. For this situation the most frequently specified shapes are the V bevel, compound bevel, and U bevel, all of which can have varying angles, lands, and tolerances. See Fig. A6.15. Recent advances in SAW narrow-gap welding as applied to piping butt welds have cut the volume of filler metal significantly in pipe walls that are 2 in (51 mm) and thicker. The 30 or 37¹⁄₂�(60 or 75�included angle) V bevel is most often performed integrally with the cutting operation by machine, oxyfuel gas, or arc cutting. Other bevel shapes such as the compound V, U, J bevels, or combinations thereof require machining in lathes or boring mills. 1. Alignment: Alignment for butt welding can often be a frustrating task since it is influenced by the material; pipe diameter, wall thickness, out-of-roundness tolerances; welding process needs; and design requirements. When a joint can be double welded, the effects of misalignment are minimized since both inner and outer weld surfaces can be blended into the base metal, and any remaining offsets can be faired out. ASME Section III gives a table of allowable offsets due to misalignment in double-welded joints. See Table A6.5. All resulting offsets must be faired to a 3:1 taper over the finished weld. For single-welded joints alignment can be more difficult, since the inside surface is not accessible. The degree of misalignment is influenced by many factors and depending on the type of service application may or may not be significant. The various codes impose limits on inside-diameter misalignment. This is to assure that the stress intensification resulting from the misalignment is kept within a reasonable value. The B31.1 Code requires that the misalignment between ends to be joined not exceed ¹⁄₁₆ in (2.0 mm), unless the design specifically permits greater amounts. See Fig. A6.16. The B31.4 and B31.8 Codes do not require special treatment unless the difference in the nominal walls of the adjoining ends exceeds ³⁄₃₂ in (2.5 mm).

ASME Section III on the other hand requires that the inside diameters of the adjoining sections match within ¹⁄₁₆ in (2.0 mm) to assure good alignment. Count- erboring is usually required to attain this degree of alignment. The welding process and NDEs to be employed also bear on misalignment limits.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.287 FIGURE A6.16 Butt welding of piping components with internal mis- alignment. (ASME B31.1 Power Piping Code, 1995 ed.) gas tungsten arc root pass welding with and without consumable inserts require closer tolerances. See PFI ES-21.30 Radiographic or ultrasonic examinations of misaligned areas may show unacceptable indications if the degree of misalignment is too great. A review of the tolerances permitted in the manufacture of various types of pipe, fittings, and forgings immediately reveals that in many situations the probable inside diameter and wall thickness variations will produce unacceptable misalign- ment situations. Out-of-roundness in lighter wall materials can add to the problem. When most of the pipe comes from the same rolling and the fittings from the same manufacturing lot, variations in tolerances are minimal and the pipe and fittings can be assembled for most common applications without a great deal of adjustment. Out-of-round problems in lighter walls are handled with internal or external round-up devices. To assure that all components will be capable of alignment in the field, it is common practice for the designer to specify that the inside diameters of all matching components be machine counterbored to some specified dimension. This practice is also desirable for shop welding of heavier wall piping subassemblies. PFI ES-21 contains a set of uniform dimensions for counterboring of seamless hot-rolled pipe ordered to A106 or A335 by NPS and schedule number. See Table A6.6. The C dimension is determined from the following equation: / 1 32 where A �pipe outside diameter ¹⁄₃₂ in �pipe outside diameter under tolerance tm �mill minimum wall �0.875t t �mill nominal wall 0.010 �a boring tolerance This simplifies to: The tolerance on C is �0.010 �0.040 in (�0.25 mm, �1.02 mm).

For other types of seamless pipe, longitudinally welded pipe, forged and bored pipe, and other specialties, the tolerances on the outside diameter and wall thickness are different. The machining tolerance required for some welding processes may also be different. However, similar logic may be applied in determining C dimensions for these products. (See PFI ES-21.) It should be noted from Table A6.6 that the tabulation applies to wall thickness greater than ¹⁄₂ in (12.7 mm). While one can calculate a C dimension for lighter walls, the combination of outside diameter tolerance and wall thickness tolerance will usually result in a calculated C which is often smaller than the actual bore of the pipe. The difference is most often relatively small, and the existing diameter will usually be suitable for alignment of most welds. In those cases where it is considered essential, the outside diameter at the end can be sized to provide stock for machining, but care is required to assure that the minimum wall is maintained. Where counterboring is used, the machined surface should taper into the existing inside surface at an angle of 30�maximum. See Fig. A6.17. There are many instances where round-up devices and counterboring are insuffi- cient remedies for misalignment. On occasion it may be necessary to expand the ends where counterboring would violate minimum wall requirements. Most of the codes permit the use of weld metal deposits (weld buildup) both on the inside and outside surfaces of the weld end in order to attain the required alignment. In

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.291 to the pipe. In such instances the heavier sections are machined to match the lighter pipe wall and the excess thickness tapered both internally and externally to form a transition zone. Limits imposed by the various codes for this transition zone are fairly uniform. The external surface of the heavier component is tapered at an angle of 30�maximum for a minimum length equal to 1¹⁄₂ times the pipe minimum wall thickness and then at 45�for a minimum of ¹⁄₂ times the pipe minimum wall. Internally, either a straight bore followed by a 30�slope or a taper bore at a maximum slope of 1 to 3 for a minimum distance of 2 times the pipe minimum wall are required. See Fig. A6.17. The surface of the weld can also be tapered to accommodate differing thickness. This taper should not exceed 30�, although some codes limit the taper to 1 to 4. It may be necessary to deposit weld metal to assure that these limits are not violated. Fillet Welds. Circumferential fillet welds are used in piping systems to join slip- on flanges and socket welding fittings and flanges to pipe. In welding slip-on flanges to pipe, the pipe is inserted into the flange and welded with two fillet welds, one between the outside surface of the pipe and the hub of the flange and the other FIGURE A6.18 Slip-on and socket welding flange welds. (ASME B31.1, 1995 ed.) between the inside surface of the flange and the thickness of the pipe. See Fig. A6.18. Alignment is relatively simple since the pipe fits inside the flange. The B31.1 Code requires that the fillet between the hub and the pipe have a minimum weld leg of 1.09 times the pipe nominal wall or the thickness of the hub, whichever is smaller. The weld leg of the front weld must be equal to the pipe nominal wall or ¹⁄₄ in, whichever is smaller. The gap between the outside diameter of the pipe and flange inside diameter may increase with size, so the size of the fillet leg should be adjusted to compensate for this situation. Fillet welds are also used for circumferential welding of pipe to socket fittings. Socket weld fittings and flanges are available in sizes up to NPS 4 (DN 100) but are most frequently used in sizes NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller. Alignment is not a problem since the pipe fits into the fitting socket. Some codes require that the fillet have uniform leg sizes equal to 1.09 times the pipe nominal wall or be equal to the socket wall, whichever is smaller. In making up socket joints it is recommended that the pipe not be bottomed in the socket before welding. B31.1 and ASME Section III suggest a ¹⁄₁₆-in (2.0 mm) gap. In high-temperature service especially, the pipe inside the socket will expand to a greater degree than the socket itself,

Intersection-type weld joints occur when the longitudinal axes of the two components meet at some angle. Such is the case where nozzle, lateral, and wye intersections are fabricated by welding. Weld joints in these cases may be butt, fillet, or a combination thereof. Nozzles are made either by set- on or set-through construction. In set-on construction, the opening in the header pipe is made equal to the inside diameter of the branch pipe. The branch pipe is contoured to the outside diameter of the header and beveled so that the weld is made between the outside surface of the header and through the thickness of the branch. The through thickness weld is covered by a fillet weld to blend it into the header pipe surface. In set-through construction an opening is cut in the header pipe equal to the outside diameter of the branch pipe and beveled. The branch pipe is contoured to match the inside diameter of the header. See Fig. A6.19. The weld is between the outside surface of the branch and through the thickness of the header and is covered with a fillet weld to blend it into the outside surface of the branch. Either type of construction is acceptable; the usual practice is to use set- on since the volume of required weld metal is less. However, when the header is FIGURE A6.19 Types of branch nozzle construction. (a) Set-on; (b) set-through; (c) set-on with reinforcing pad; (d) special drill through socket weld coupling.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.293 made from a plate product which may contain laminations, set-through construction is preferred. Small nozzles are frequently made with socket welding or threaded couplings set on the header. In these cases it is difficult to assure complete root penetration, and specially designed couplings which permit drilling through the bore to remove the root of the weld are often used. See Fig. A6.19. Welded-nozzle construction cannot be used at the full rating of the pipe involved, and suitability for particular pressure temperatures must be verified by component design methods found in Part B of this book. In all cases there must be a through thickness weld of the branch to the header. Where reinforcing pads are used, they should also be joined to the header by a weld through their thickness. See Fig. A6.19 for typical details. In designing headers with multiple outlet nozzles, sufficient clearance is needed between adjacent nozzles to provide accessibility for welding. Nozzles with reinforcing pads or flanges need greater clearance. PFI ES-731 gives suggested minimum spacings. Root Pass Weldings. The integrity of any weld rests primarily with the quality of the root pass. In double-welded joints the root pass serves as a backing for passes welded from the first side. Before welding begins from the opposite side, the root area is usually removed to sound metal. In most cases, however, pipe welds must be made from one side only, and the inside surface of the root weld is not accessible for conditioning. Backing Rings. The earliest solution to root pass welding was the use of a backing ring using the SMAW process. This usually assured good penetration and is still used for many applications. However, commercial rings used with nominal pipe dimensions may result in unwanted flow restriction, crevices for entrapment of corrosion products, and notch conditions which could result in cracking during service. Prior to the introduction of GTAW root welding, piping systems which required the highest possible quality were welded using counterboring of the pipe to close tolerances and machined backing rings. This reduced problems significantly, but the crack potential still remained. See PFI ES-132 Open Butt Root Welds. In petrochemical services backing rings often could not be used, and the practice of open butt welding with shielded metal arc electrodes was and still is used. Welders require considerably more skill. Welding is most often performed with E-XX10 electrodes, which are more controllable than the low- hydrogen types but are also more prone to porosity. GTAW Root Welds. The introduction of GTAW represented a breakthrough in root pass welding. Because of the greater expense involved, its application is usually limited to applications requiring high-quality root welds. The weld end bevels are carefully prepared by machining and counterboring where necessary to meet the close tolerances required. The joint involves butted or open lands, and the weld is made with filler metal added or with a preplaced consumable insert. The latter have a decided advantage in that they eliminate a good deal of the variability introduced by hand feeding of filler wire. Consumable inserts come in a variety of shapes, each requiring somewhat differing fit-up tolerances. See PFI ES-21. Some types can be used for root pass welding in lighter wall materials (¹⁄₂ in and less) without the need for counterboring. Depending on the service, the inside surface of the molten weld puddle is often shielded from oxidation by an inert gas inside the pipe contained between dams. See Fig. A6.20. A small, con- trolled, positive pressure on the backing gas can aid in better controlling the shape of the root inside diameter. When the root pass is made by the GTAW process, the resulting finished weld is relatively thin. In depositing the second and third passes, the first pass may be

This condition is usually considered acceptable provided the resulting thickness through the finished weld is equal to or greater than the required minimum wall, and the concavity blends smoothly into the adjacent base metal. GMAW Root Welds. Many fabricators and/or installers take advantage of the low penetrating power of GMAW in the short-circuiting mode to use it for open- butt root pass welding where the quality level of GTAW root pass welding is not required. The balance of the weld is made by other processes. Care must be taken to assure that unmelted wire does not penetrate the joint and remain. Welding of Ferrous Piping Materials Carbon Steels. Carbon steels are classed as P-No.1 by ASME Section IX. See Table A6.3. The vast majority of carbon steel pipe is used for services below 775�F (413�C). Joints are most often V bevels with commercial backing rings or open butt roots and are welded out with SMAW, SAW, GMAW, and FCAW. For services which require high quality, GTAW root welds with SMAW, SAW, and FCAW weld-outs are most prevalent. Most carbon steel filler metal is produced to weld 60,000- and 70,000-psi material. More often than not fabricators use the 70,000-psi filler for all carbon steel welding. For SMAW the most popular electrode is E-7018, although for open-butt root pass welding using SMAW, E-6010 is still the choice. FCAW welding is rapidly replacing SMAW because it can deposit at a much higher rate. Preheating and postweld heat treating are required depending on the carbon content and wall thickness. For typical preheat and postweld heat treatment require- ments see Tables A6.4 and A6.7. When working to a specific code, be sure to use the requirements found in that code. Carbon Molybdenum Steels. Carbon molybdenum steels are classed as P-No 3. Currently this material has very little use because of unfavorable experience with graphitization at temperatures over 800�F (427�C). Chromium Molybdenum Steels. The chromium molybdenum steels are primar- ily used for service temperatures from 800 to 1050�F (427 to 565�C). They range from ¹⁄₂ Cr-¹⁄₂ Mo to 9 CR-1 Mo-V and are classed by ASME Section IX as P-No. 3, P-No. 4, and P-No. 5 A and 5 B. The preponderance of usage is in the 1¹⁄₄ Cr-¹⁄₂ Mo-Si and 2¹⁄₄ Cr-1 Mo grades. Welding usually consists of GTAW root welds with filler metal added or preplaced inserts. The balance of the weld is made by SAW for welds which can be performed in the 1G position and SMAW for fixed position welds. FCAW is rapidly overtaking SMAW for these materials also. See

A.296 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Tables A6.4 and A6.7 for typical preheat and postweld heat-treatment requirements. Note that in B31.3 hardness limits are imposed to verify the adequacy of any heat treatment, and above-critical heat treatment may be necessary to attain the maximum hardness limit. The 9Cr-1Mo-V material is a relatively recent addition to the list of chromium molybdenum steels for use in high-temperature service. Its great advantage over other chrome moly steels is its high-temperature strength. It has allowable stresses comparable with those of austenitic stainless steels. This results in a lesser wall thickness and consequently less weight to support and considerably less volume of filler material. A tighter line configuration can be anticipated because the lesser section modulous will result in smaller reactions at the terminals due to expan- sion loadings. This material also has an advantage over austenitic stainless steels in that its coefficient of thermal expansion is less than that of the stainlesses, again resulting in lower end reactions for the same configuration. On the down side, 9Cr-1Mo-V is typically a martensitic structure at room temper- ature and requires great care in bending, welding, and postbending and welding heat treatment. For hot bending, a temperature of 1740 to 1920�F (950 to 1050�C) is preferred. Bending in the temperature range of 1560 to 1740�F (850 to 950�C) should be avoided. After hot bending, a normalize at 1900 to 1990�F (1040 to 1090�C) is required to put carbides back into solution. The normalize is followed by a tempering heat treatment between 1350 and 1440�F (730 and 780�C). Both are followed by cooling in still air. Welding is extremely critical. The latest ASME Section II Part C, lists 9Cr-1Mo- V filler materials. SFA 5.5 lists E9018-B9 for SMAW electrodes, and SFA 5.28 lists ER90S-B9 for rods and electrodes for gas-shielded welding. Storage and handling of electrodes is very critical (see Filler Metals). Preheat and interpass temperatures and postwelding cooling should be scrupulously observed (see Preheat and Interpass Temperature). Postwelding stress relief is a necessity. The current ASME B31.1 Code requires a range of 1300 to 1400�F (700 to 760�C), but some literature indicates that a range of 1360 to 1440�F (740 to 780�C) may be more desirable for reasonable hardness and good ductility. The time at temperature should be 1 h per in of thickness, and heating and cooling rates above 800�F (427�C) should be limited to 100�F (55�C) per h. Martensitic and Ferritic Stainless Steels. The martensitic and ferritic grades of stainless steels are not often encountered in piping systems. They are a group of steels with chromium contents ranging from 11.5 to 30 percent. Martensitic stainless steels are those which are capable of transformation to martensite under most cooling conditions and therefore can be hardened. Ferritic stainless steels on the other hand contain sufficient chromium and other ferrite formers such as aluminium, niobium, molybdenum, and titanium so that they cannot be hardened by heat treatment. ASME Section IX classes martensitic stainless steels as P-No.6 and ferritic stainless steels as P-No.7. The user should consult the Welding Handbook16 for suggested welding processes and the applicable code for specific preheating and postweld heat-treatment requirements. Austenitic Stainless Steels. Austenitic stainless steels are classed as P No. 8. Piping systems of austenitic stainless steels represent a fairly significant proportion of a fabricator’s and/or installer’s work, since they appear in nuclear power plants, chemical plants, paper mills, food processing facilities, and other applications where cleanliness and corrosion resistance are mandatory and even in fossil power plants where their high-temperature properties are needed. Most root welding is done by

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.297 the GTAW process, and the inside of the root is protected by purging with argon, helium, or nitrogen to prevent formation of hard chromic oxides. GTAW is used for weld-out in lighter walls, and combinations of GTAW, SMAW, and SAW are used for heavier sections. Filler metal must contain some ferrite to preclude microfissuring as described in the section ‘‘Filler Metals.’’ To minimize the precipita- tion of carbides (sensitization) during welding, interpass temperatures are usually limited to 300 to 350�F (150 to 175�C). Heat treatment after welding is not manda- tory. For corrosion services, heating during fabrication could be detrimental since it would serve to enhance sensitization. The effects of sensitization can be mitigated by a carbide solution heat treatment as described in the section ‘‘Heat Treatment.’’ Low-carbon grades of stainless steels welded with L grade electrodes are also used in services where sensitization can be a problem. Low-Temperature Steels. The term low-temperature steel is applied to a variety of steels which exhibit good notch toughness properties at temperatures down to cryogenic levels. The B31.1 and B31.3 Codes permit the use of most steel down to �20�F (�29�C). Below this, certain grades of carbon and nickel steel with good toughness and austenitic stainless steels are needed. Welding procedures and welding filler metals must be tested to assure suitability for the intended service. B31.3 gives details of such requirements. Root pass welding using GTAW, with SMAW and SAW weld- out, is commonly used. Some FCAW is used in the carbon steels and low-nickel steels. A preheat of 200�F (95�C) is suggested by B31.3 for low-nickel steels followed by a postweld heat treatment consisting of a stress relieve at 1100 to 1175�F (600 to 630�C) when the wall exceeds ³⁄₄ in (19 mm). For 9 percent nickel steel a preheat of 50�F (10�C) and a stress relieve at 1025 to 1085�F (552 to 585�C) followed by cooling at a rate greater than 300�F/h (167�C/h) down to 600�F (316�C) is required. Certain nonferrous materials are also suitable for low-temperature service. See the following section. Welding of Nonferrous Metals Aluminum. Aluminum and aluminum alloys have high thermal conductivity, high coefficients of thermal expansion, and high fluidity in the molten state. The predominant welding methods used for joining them are GMAW and GTAW, both manually and in automatic modes. Joint designs are much like those used for ferritic metals, except that the included angles are usually 60 to 75�, increasing to 90 or 110�for welding overhead. The root pass may be welded against a permanent aluminum backing strip or removable stainless-steel backup or with an open butt or consumable insert. Joint cleanliness is very important, so oil, grease, and dirt must be removed. For heavy oxide, wire brushing or chemical cleaning may be required. Preheating is normally not needed but may be required when the mass of the parts is large enough to conduct the heat of welding away from the joint faster than it can be supplied by the arc. Depending on the welding process used, as the weld thickness increases from about ¹⁄₄ to 1 in (19 to 25 mm), a preheat of 200 to 600�F (95 to 316�C) may be required. Since the properties and tempers of certain alloys may be affected, care should be exercised when preheat is applied. Shielding gases are usually helium or argon. For critical applications and heavier sections a mixture of 75 percent helium, 25 percent argon is recommended. Heat treatment after welding is not required. It is important to remember that the annealing effect of the heat of welding can reduce the strength level of cold-worked and heat-treatable alloys. In this case the allowable stress value for the material in the annealed condition should be used

A.298 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS for design. An exception to this can be made in the case of heat-treatable materials when the finished weldment is subjected to the same heat treatment which produced the original temper and both the base metal and weld joint are similarly affected. Aluminum and aluminum alloys are suitable for service temperatures down to �452�F (�269�C). See B31.3 for information on this subject. Copper and Copper Alloys. Although copper and copper alloys can be welded by other processes, GTAW welding is commonly applicable for all-position welding of most copper and copper alloys. GMAW with pulsed current can also be used for some alloys. Shielding gases may be argon, helium, or mixtures thereof. Argon is preferred for walls to ¹⁄₈ in (3 mm), but a 75 percent helium, 25 percent argon mixture is most often used for heavier walls and weld positions other than flat (1G). Like aluminum, the coppers have high thermal conductivity and high coefficient of thermal expansion. Accordingly, preheating is recommended to compensate for heat loss at the joint due to the metal mass and to reduce distortion. Welding current should not be used to compensate for heat loss. The degree of preheat is a function of alloy, welding process, and metal mass. More heat input is needed for the pure coppers, with decreasing amounts needed as the alloy content increases. Preheat should increase with wall thickness, from about 200�F (95�C) for ¹⁄₄-in (6 mm) wall increasing to 750�F (400�C) minimum for walls ⁵⁄₈ in (16 mm) and over. Surface cleanliness is very important, and some alloys require a chemical cleaning to remove oxides. Copper-nickel alloys are susceptible to hot cracking if sulfur is present. The heat of welding will soften the HAZ of cold-worked material, and it will be weaker than the base metal. When precipitation-hardenable alloys are used, it is recommended that welding be done on base metal in the annealed condition and the entire weldment be given the precipitation-hardening heat treatment. For detailed information refer to the Welding Handbook,16 the Metals Handbook,20 or contact the Copper Development Association. Many coppers are suitable for services down to �325�F (�199�C), See ASME B31.3. Nickel and Nickel Alloys. Nickel and its alloys can be welded by SMAW, GTAW, and GMAW. SAW is limited to certain compositions. Welding is similar to austenitic stainless steels except that the molten metal is more sluggish and does not wet as well. Larger groove angles may be required. Preheat is not required, but welding at temperatures below 60�F (16�C) in the presence of moisture is not recommended. A low interpass temperature is suggested. For GTAW welding shielding gas is normally argon, but helium or an argon-helium mix may be used. The inside surface of GTAW root welds should be shielded with an inert gas. GMAW in the spray, pulsed, globular, or short-circuiting modes may be used with argon or argon-helium mixtures as shielding. Postweld heat treatment is not usually required. Many nickel and nickel alloys may be used down to �325�F (�199�C). For more detailed information refer to the Welding Handbook,16 the Metals Hand- book,20 and ASME B31.3. Titanium. Titanium and its alloys are normally welded using the GTAW and GMAW processes. It is vital that the HAZ and molten metal be protected from the atmosphere by a blanket of inert gas during welding. Most welding is done in a protective chamber purged with an inert gas or by using trailing shields. Precleaning is extremely important. Use of degreasers, stainless steel wire brushes, or chemical solutions may be required. Preheating or postweld heat treatment are not normally required. See the Welding Handbook16 and the Metals Handbook.20 Dissimilar Metals. Until now we have discussed welding where both items being joined are essentially the same material and are joined with a filler metal of similar

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.299 chemistry and physical properties. Occasions arise where metals of different chemi- cal composition and physical properties must be joined. In joining dissimilar metals, normal welding techniques may be employed if the two base metals have melting temperatures within about 200�F (95�C) of each other. Otherwise different joining techniques are required. In designing a welding procedure for dissimilar metals, a great many factors must be considered. Service conditions such as temperature, corrosion, and the degree of thermal cycling may apply. The effects of dilution of the two base metals by the filler and each other must be evaluated to assure a sound weld with suitable chemical, physical, metallurgical, and corrosion-resistant properties. Similarly, pre- heat and postweld heat treatment requirements for one base metal may not be suitable for the other. It is usually necessary to qualify a separate welding procedure for the particular combination of base metals and filler material. ASME Section IX should be con- sulted for specifics. As a general rule, when welding within a family such as ferritic to ferritic, austenitic to austenitic, or nickel alloy to nickel alloy, the filler metal may be of the same nominal composition as either of the base metals or of an intermediate composition. The filler metal normally used to weld the lower alloy is most often pre- ferred. The previous advice may not always hold true. It has been noted that when welding P 22 (2¹⁄₄Cr-1Mo) to P 91 (9Cr-1Mo-V) using 2¹⁄₄Cr filler metal at high temperatures, carbon migration from the 2¹⁄₄Cr weld metal to the 9Cr base metal can produce a carbon-denuded zone at the interface, resulting in a weakened area. One recommendation is to ‘‘butter’’ the 9Cr side with a 5Cr filler metal, heat-treat the buttered segment, and complete the weld with 2¹⁄₄Cr. Bear in mind that the 5Cr filler may not have high-temperature properties similar to the 2¹⁄₄Cr, and design the weldment accordingly. In welding dissimilar materials, selection of preheating and postweld heat treat- ment requires a great deal of care. What is desirable for one metal may be detrimen- tal to another. Some compromise may be required. Establishing a welding procedure for welding ferritic to austenitic steels requires careful consideration of the service conditions. For moderate service temperatures (below 800�F or 427�C), where the thickness of the ferritic side does not require postweld heat treatment, austenitic stainless steel electrodes are often the choice. Some prefer electrodes such as type 309 or 310 because of their higher chrome content. Because of the thickness involved, the ferritic member may require some type of postweld heat treatment. In this case the preferred method is to butter the ferritic weld surface with a nickel-chrome-iron (NiCrFe) filler metal such as ERNiCrMo-3 (see ASME Section II Part C SFA-5.14) and postweld heat-treat the buttered section as required for the ferritic composition. The buttered section is then prepared for welding, set up with the austenitic side, and the weld between the butter and austenitic base metal is completed with NiCrFe filler metal without subsequent postweld heat treatment. See Fig. A6.21. For high-temperature service (above 800�F or 427�C) the buttering procedure just described is also recommended. There is a difference in coefficients of expansion between the ferritic and austenitic metals. This difference will result in expansion stresses above the yield point at the weld juncture while at operating temperature. At higher temperatures there is also greater probability of diffusion of carbon from the ferritic side to the austenitic side. The NiCrFe ‘‘butter’’ minimizes the carbon diffusion problem and has an expansion coefficient which is intermediate between the two base metals, thus reducing but not eliminating the thermal stress at the interface. Where a transition from ferritic to austenitic steels is required in high-

(a) For moderate temperature service; (b) for high-temperature services or where stress relief on the ferritic side is required. temperature applications involving cyclic services, a transition piece of a high- nickel alloy such as UNS N06600 with two welds is often used to reduce thermal fatigue damage. In welding nonferrous metals to ferrous or other nonferrous metals, a filler metal with a melting point comparable to the lower melting point base metal is usually recommended. Nickel and nickel alloys are invariably welded to ferrous metals with nickel- alloy filler metals. Sulfur embrittlement can be a problem with nickel to ferritic welds, just as it is in nickel-to-nickel welds. Copper-nickel and nickel-copper alloys should not be joined with filler materials containing iron or chromium since hot cracking may result. Copper and copper alloys can be welded to carbon steel with silicon bronze or aluminum bronze electrodes, but the preferred method is to butter the carbon steel side with nickel and weld the copper to the nickel butter with nickel filler. This will preclude hot cracking of the copper because of iron dilution. The copper side may require preheat. Copper can easily be welded to nickel, copper-nickel, or nickel- copper filler metal. When welding nickel alloys which contain iron or chromium to copper, the nickel alloy should be buttered with nickel. Aluminum and titanium generally cannot be welded to ferrous or other nonfer- rous metal using currently available welding procedures, and special joining proce- dures must be employed.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.301 Clad, Metal-Coated, and Lined Pipe. There are instances when it is economi- cally desirable to construct a piping system from relatively inexpensive material but with an interior surface having corrosion- or erosion-resistant properties. Clad pipe may be made by seam welding of clad plate, by weld metal overlay of the inside surface, or by centrifugal casting of a pipe with two metal layers. Lined pipe is made by welding a linear, sometimes as strips, to the inside surface of the pipe. Metal-coated pipe is made by dipping, metal spraying, or plating the entire pipe. Before choosing construction which requires welding of clad, lined, or metal- coated pipe, such factors as filler metal compatibility, filler metal strength relative to the base metal strength, dilution of base metal into the finished weld, and need for postfabrication heat treatment must be considered. Because it is not possible to cover the great many combinations of base metals and cladding, lining, or metal coatings, some examples of the more common applications will be given. For corrosion services, a carbon steel base material, clad or lined with austenitic stainless steel, is often used. The cladding is usually about ³⁄₃₂ to ⁵⁄₃₂ in thick. Where the inside of the weld is accessible, the preferred method is to weld the base metal from the outside with carbon steel filler metal, back-gouge the root from the inside, and weld the root from the inside with two or more passes of austenitic filler metal to minimize dilution from the base metal. See Fig. A6.22a. Where the inside surface is not accessible, a backing strip of the same composition as the cladding, fillet welded to the cladding on the upstream side may be used. The root weld between the two clad surfaces and the austenitic backing strip is then made with austenitic filler metal. The root weld can also be made with the GTAW process using austenitic filler or preplaced inserts. The carbon steel should be removed for a sufficient distance back to preclude dilution into the root weld. In most instances, the balance of the weld is usually made with austenitic filler metal since it is not good practice to deposit carbon steel or low-alloy steel directly against the stainless steel deposit. See Fig. A6.22b. In some cases, nickel-base alloys are used for cladding where high-temperature corrosion is involved. The joints may be treated much like the austenitic cladding, except that appropriate nickel-base filler metals are used. Some services require the use of carbon steel pipe nickel plated on the inside surface. Since the plating is relatively thin, different approaches are needed. First, as much fabrication as possible should be done prior to plating. For joints to be welded after plating, the ends to be prepared for welding should be buttered with nickel filler metal and machined to the required contour prior to plating. The root weld is made using the GTAW process with nickel filler metal. See Fig. A6.22c. Some occasions require the use of aluminized pipe. Steel pipe is prefab- ricated and coated with aluminum by immersion in a bath of molten aluminum or by metal spray. Where the inside of the weld will not be accessible for metal spray, one method of joining is to counterbore the ends and use a solid machined backing ring which is fit and welded into one side of the joint prior to coating. After coating, the weld is made using an appropriate base metal process and filler, taking care not to blister the aluminum coating on the underside of the backing ring. Galvanized steel pipe is often used for external corrosion applications. Since welding of galvanized pipe releases toxic vapors and since the welded area most often cannot be regalvanized, welding of galvanized pipe is not recommended. It is preferable that the assemblies be fabricated with provisions for mechanical joining in the field and then galvanized. For services involving erosion, carbon steel pipe is often lined with cement or

In this case the joints are butted together to minimize the gap between the adjacent linings. The weld is then made between the two carbon steel weld bevels, recognizing that full penetration through the carbon steel joint may not be achieved and that additional thickness may be necessary for strength. The gap between the adjacent linings is usually not a problem if only erosion is present. Brazing and Soldering Brazing. For services involving the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or the B31 Code for Pressure Piping, brazing procedures and brazers must be

*Source: piping-handbook*

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.303 qualified in accordance with ASME Section IX similar to welding procedures and welders. See the section ‘‘Procedure and Personnel Qualification.’’ There are a great many types of brazing processes. In establishing a brazing procedure, consideration must be given to the ability of the filler metal to produce suitable physical properties, its melting point and wettability, possible base metal and filler metal interactions, loss of base metal properties, increased sensitization to corrosion, increased hardness in the base metal due to brazing temperature, and the need for postbrazing heat treatments. Since most piping materials can be welded, the use of brazing for joining is rather limited. It is most often used for joining coppers and for combinations of metals which cannot be welded. Brazing is a process wherein the base metals do not melt, the filler metal has a liquidus above 840�F (450�C), and the filler metal wets the base metal and is drawn into the joint by capillary action. Although butt or scarf joints can be used, a lapped joint with an overlap of 3 times the thickness of the thinner member gives the best joint efficiency and ease of fabrication. It should be noted that typical copper or brass fittings have a depth of socket based on the strength of tin-lead solders. When brazing is used, only a small percentage of that depth is needed. Required clearance between the faying surfaces usually vary from 0.001 to 0.010 in (0.025 to 0.25 mm) depending on the filler and flux combination used during the operation. The flux melts upon application of heat and is displaced by the molten filler metal. Flux residue should be removed after the operation is complete. Silver, copper-phosphorus, and copper-zinc filler metals are most often used for copper brazing. Torch brazing is commonly used for fabrication and installation of copper piping systems. For torch brazing, the type of fuel gas selected is a function of the melting temperature required to melt the filler metal. For piping joints NPS 2 (DN 50) and larger, use of a second torch to preheat may be desirable. In brazing metals with differing coefficients of expansion, it is preferable that the metal with the higher expansion coefficient form the socket and the metal of the lower expansion coefficient form the pipe or tube. Clearance between the parts at room temperature must be adjusted so there will be a suitable clearance at brazing temperature. On cooling, the greater contraction of the socket will put the joint in a compressive stress state. Soldering. Unlike welding and brazing, ASME Section IX has no requirements for qualification of soldering procedures or personnel. Soldering is much like brazing in that the base metals are not melted, the faying surfaces are wetted by the filler, and the filler is drawn into the joint by capillary action. However, the melting point of the filler metal is lower than 840�F (450�C) usually between 450 and 500�F (230 and 260�C). Since the strength of soldering filler metals is considerably less than that of brazing fillers, a longer overlap is required to develop a joint equal to base metal strength. A clearance of about 0.003 in is preferred for optimum strength. A good soldered joint depends again on the cleanliness of the faying surfaces. Fluxes are used to assist in the wetting action by removing tarnish films and to prevent oxidation. Rosin fluxes and organic fluxes are used for most materials. Inorganic fluxes may be required for certain other materials that can be soldered, while in some cases precoating of the material with a surface that can be soldered may be required. Most piping applications use tin-lead solders. These range in composition from 5 percent tin, 95 percent lead to 70 percent tin, 30 percent lead, with 50 percent tin, 50 percent lead the most common. Tin-antimony and tin- silver solders are also frequently used. For soldering aluminum, tin-zinc and zinc- aluminum are used.

A.304 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS For additional information refer to the Welding Handbook16 and The Theory and Technique of Soldering and Brazing of Piping Systems.33 Heat Treatment Purpose. Heat treatment during piping fabrication is performed for a variety of reasons (i.e., to soften material for working, to relieve fabrication stresses, to restore metallurgical and physical properties, etc.). During fabrication, ferritic steels undergo phase changes during heating and cooling, while the austenitic stainless steels and nonferrous piping materials do not; consequently differing criteria must be applied. Ferritic Steels. Ferritic steels undergo a phase change on heating and cooling during fabrication operations because their principal component (iron) is allotropic; that is, it undergoes a change in crystalline structure with temperature. At room temperature iron favors a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure called alpha iron, but on heating to 1670�F (910�C) it changes to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure called gamma iron and subsequently at 2534�F (1390�C) it reverts to a BCC called delta iron. The addition of carbon to the iron to form steel and additions of other elements such as chromium, manganese, molybdenum, and nickel to form alloys modify the temperatures at which transformation occurs and the manner in which the crystalline structure forms into grains. As an example, a melt of 0.30 percent carbon steel will first begin to solidify as delta iron and a liquid, then at about 2680�F (1479�C) to an interstitial solid solution of carbon in gamma iron called austenite. At about 1500�F (815�C) this will transform into a mixture of austenite and ferrite, which at 1333�F (721�C) becomes ferrite and pearlite. Ferrite is alpha iron which contains small amounts of carbon (up to a maximum of about 0.02 percent) in solid solution. The excess carbon not in solid solution with the ferrite forms as iron carbide (Fe3C) or cementite. The cementite forms as thin plates alternating with ferrite. This structure is known as pearlite. The temperatures at which the transformations occur are called critical tempera- tures or transformation temperatures. The lower critical temperature, usually desig- nated A1, is that point on heating where the BCC ferrite and pearlite phase begins to transform to FCC austenitic structure, and the upper critical temperature, A3, is the temperature at which the transformation is complete. Between these two points the structure is a mix of ferrite-pearlite and austenite. These temperatures are of importance in postbending and postwelding heat treatments as well as qualifi- cation of welding procedures. The critical temperatures are a function of chemical composition and as such will vary with alloy. As an example, for 9Cr-1Mo-V, the lower critical is located between 1525 and 1560�F (830 and 850�C), and the upper critical is between 1650 and 1725�F (900 and 940�C). Some approximate methods of calculating critical temperature are found in Welding Metallurgy34 and The Making, Shaping and Treat- ing of Steel.35 Some approximate lower critical temperatures are given in Table A6.8. Critical temperatures are affected by heating and cooling rates. An increase in heating rate will serve to increase the transformation temperatures, while an increase in cooling rate will tend to depress them. The more rapid the rate of heating or cooling, the greater the variation from the critical temperature at equilibrium conditions. Most sources will indicate the lower and upper critical temperatures on heating as Ac1 and Ac3, respectively, and the upper and lower on cooling as the Ar3 and Ar1, respectively. In the case of our 0.30 percent carbon steel, cooling from the austenite phase through the critical range at a rate of 50�F/h (28�C/h) or less will result in the soft, ductile ferrite-pearlite structure. On the other hand, extremely

This is be- cause the austenite FCC crystals did not have time to transform to BCC ferrite and cementite. Heat treatments which are applied to ferritic steels are related to the critical temperatures and depending on which is applied will have differing results. These are annealing, normalizing, normalizing and tempering, and stress relieving. See Fig. A6.23. Annealing is used to reduce hardness, improve machinability, or produce a more uniform microstructure. It involves heating to a temperature above the upper critical or to a point within the critical range, holding for a period of time to assure temperature uniformity, then following with a slow furnace-controlled cooling through the critical range. Normalizing is used to refine and homogenize the grain structure and to provide more uniform mechanical properties and higher resistance to impact loadings. It involves heating to a temperature above the upper critical temperature, holding for a time to permit complete transformation to austenite, and cooling in still air from the austenitizing temperature. A normalized structure may be pearlitic, bainitic, or even martensitic depending on the cooling rate. If there is a concern for excessive hardness and attendant low ductility, a tempering treatment may follow the normalizing treatment. Tempering involves heating to a temperature below the lower critical and slowly cooling to room temperature, much like a stress relief. The degree of tempering depends on the tempering temperature selected. The higher the tempering temperature, the greater the degree of softening. A stress-relieving heat treatment is primarily intended to reduce residual stresses resulting from bending and welding. It involves heating to a temperature below the lower critical; holding for a predetermined time, depending on thickness and material, to permit the residual stresses to creep out; and then slowly cooling to room temperature. Some typical time-temperature cycles are shown in Table A6.7. Austenitic Stainless Steels. Austenitic stainless steels do not undergo phase changes like the ferritic steels. They remain austenitic at all temperatures and so heat treatments usually do not apply. When austenitic stainless steels are to be used in corrosive services, cold working and heating for bending may significantly lower their corrosion resistance. Cold working may result in residual stresses, and heating operations can result in sensitization. Both factors contribute to intergranu- lar stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC). When austenitic stainless steels are heated

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.307 in the range of about 800 to 1600�F (430 to 870�C), carbon in excess of about 0.02 percent will come out of solution and diffuse to the grain boundaries where it will combine with adjacent chromium to form chromium carbide (Cr23C6). This phenomenon is called sensitization. These grain boundaries are then preferentially attacked by corrosive media. The heat treatment often applied to cold-worked and sensitized stainless steels to restore corrosion resistance is a carbide solution heat treatment. In this procedure, the material is heated to a temperature above the sensitization range, usually about (1950 to 2100�F (1065 to 1150�C), and held there sufficiently long to permit the carbides to dissolve and the carbon to go back into solid solution. The material is then removed from the furnace and rapidly cooled through the sensitization range, preferably by quenching in water. The rapid cooling does not give the carbon sufficient time to come out of solution, and corrosion resistance is restored to the sensitized area. Obviously carbide solution heat treatment is limited by the furnace size and quenching facilities. It is most freqently applied to bends but is also useful in reducing sensitization and residual stresses in welds. Nonferrous Materials. Bending and forming of nonferrous materials may result in undesirable work-hardening. Some nickel alloys may be subject to carbide precipi- tation when hot bent or formed. Materials that can be hardened by precipitation require other considerations. Depending on the final use, it may be desirable to perform some type of postbending or forming heat treatment. Because of the great many new materials being developed and used, it is suggested that the user contact the material manufacturers or material associations for their recommendations on the specific material and service. Heat Treatment Methods. Shop heat treatments are most often carried out in specifically designed heat treatment furnaces, but local stress relieving of welds may also involve induction, resistance, or torch heating. Above critical heat treatments, such as annealing, normalizing, and normalizing and tempering for ferritic steel and carbide solution heat treatment for austenitic stainless steels, are performed in large heat-treatment furnaces. These same furnaces are also used for stress-relieving heat treatments of ferritic steels. Such furnaces are generally fired with natural gas, propane, or low-sulfur oil. Depending on their design, they may attain temperatures up to 2300�F (1260�C) which covers the entire spectrum of temperatures commonly encountered in piping applications. Heating and cooling rates and holding temperatures are automatically controlled. Larger furnaces may have two or more zones, each independently controlled. Records of furnace zone temperatures and material temperatures are obtained using recording potentiometers. When assemblies are too large or furnaces are not available, local stress relieving of individual welds may be accomplished in the shop using electrical induction, electrical resistance, or gas torch heating. Induction equipment involves alternating current frequencies of the order of 60 to 400 Hz. Induction generates heat within the wall of the pipe. This has the advantage of a more uniform temperature through the thickness with greater unifor- mity at the lower frequencies. The heat treatment cycle is controlled automatically with thermocouples attached directly on or adjacent to the weld. The weld and thermocouple are covered with insulating material. The induction field is generated in copper cables or solid or water-cooled copper coils external to the insulation. See Fig. A6.24. Resistance heating involves the use of direct current in suitable lengths of ni- chrome heating wire. Various configurations and sizes of prefabricated heating elements consisting of heating wires separated by ceramic beads are available

Depending on the size, wall thickness, and desired heating tempera- ture, multiple heating units and combinations of elements may be needed. The weld and heating elements are covered with insulating blankets to retain the heat. Since heating is from one side, a somewhat wider heating band on the outside may be needed to assure that the inside of the pipe attains the required temperature. Thermocouples attached directly to the weld or adjacent to it are used to control heating, holding, and cooling temperatures. Torch heating can often be used for stress relieving, but where controlled heating and cooling rates are mandated, it may be less than satisfactory. Single torches may be used for pipe up to about NPS 3 (DN 80), but ring burners are needed for larger sizes. Exothermic heating has been used in the field and is discussed in the section ‘‘In- stallation.’’ Heat Treatment Considerations Furnace Heat Treatment. To assure that heat treatments attain the results in- tended (i.e., correct heating and cooling rates, desired holding temperature in all parts, etc.), it is very important that all controlling and recording instruments be calibrated on a regular basis. The furnace should be inspected and a temperature survey made to assure that all locations within it are capable of attaining and maintaining specific temperatures within some reasonable tolerance. This is particu- larly important if the zone temperatures are used as the basis for acceptance of the heat treatment. If there is any concern, it might be advisable to attach thermocouples directly to the parts being heat-treated. When piping subassemblies are placed in the furnace, they should be supported to permit exposure of the underside to the radiant and convection heating surface. Supports should be located so as to avoid sagging. Care should be taken to avoid any flame impingement directly on surfaces being heat-treated. The ends of assemblies being heat-treated should be closed but not sealed to minimize oxidation of the inside surfaces. Occasions may arise where special surface finishes on the pipe inside surface or on flow meter sections could be adversely affected by oxidation caused by heat treatment. In such cases the inside of the assembly can be purged with an inert gas to minimize oxidation.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.309 Assemblies should be so placed as to assure the uniform application of heat. Heating and cooling rates must be selected to assure heating through the full thickness and to minimize distortion caused by uneven heating. The faster the rate of heating or cooling, the more probability of distortion. Assemblies with massive flanges, fittings, or other unusual configurations should be treated more carefully than those with butt welds only. Many of the codes have specified heating and cooling rates which are considered reasonable. Local Heat Treatment. When an assembly is too large for a furnace to accommo- date, it may be fabricated in sections which are individually furnace heat-treated and later joined by welding. The final butt welds may then be locally heat-treated in the same fashion as field welds. The most common practice is the use of induction or resistance heating. When preheating is an essential part of the welding operation, the induction or resistance equipment can be used for preheating, maintaining preheat during welding, and, finally, stress relieving. A proper stress-relieving operation will assure that the weld and HAZ through the full thickness will attain the required temperature for the required time. The B31.1 Code requires that the heated band be at least 3 times the thickness of the thickest part being joined. With induction or resistance heating the heating elements themselves often have greater coverage. Depending on the massiveness of the joint being heated, one or more pieces of heating equipment may be needed. Controlling and recording thermocouples are located on or adjacent to the weld. Usually locally heat-treated shop welds are in the 5G position (pipe horizontal, weld vertical). For small pipe sizes, a single thermocouple located at the 12 o’clock position may suffice, but for larger diameters and heavier walls at least two and preferably four, located at 90�intervals, should be employed to assure uniformity of heating. Judicious use of insulating material should be employed to minimize heat loss. When joining parts of differing masses, concentrate more heating effort on the more massive part. If it is necessary to locally stress-relieve a branch connection, not only the branch weld itself but the entire circumference of the header for a distance of at least 2 times the header thickness on either side of the branch should be heated. Heating of the weld alone, while resulting in a satisfactory stress relief, could distort the header significantly. Heating and cooling during local stress relief of pipe to pipe joints can be more rapid than for furnace applications since there is less chance of distortion unless, of course, the heating is not applied uniformly. Ends of the assembly should be closed but not sealed to reduce heat loss on the inside surface due to air flow. The main concern is assurance that the inside surface of the weld attains the required temperature for the required time. Local stress relieving with torches or gas ring burners can be effectively employed but must be limited to situations where controlled heating and cooling rates are not a factor. Code Requirements Postbending and Postforming Requirements. The designer of the piping system should specify the type of heat treatment required to assure appropriate physical, metallurgical, or corrosion-resistant properties. As an example, a normalize or normalize and temper may be required to assure certain notch toughness properties for nuclear or low-temperature applications, or a carbide solution heat treatment for cold-worked austenitic stainless steel may be required to preclude IGSCC. This should be agreed upon well before any fabrication starts. The codes have certain mandatory heat treatment requirements which must be

A.310 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS observed as a minimum, normally a stress-relieving treatment. Such heat treatment is usually in accordance with the postweld heat treatment tables given in the applica- ble code. Differing requirements apply depending on whether the bending or form- ing was performed hot or cold. According to B31.3, cold bending is performed at a temperature below the transformation range (below the lower critical), and hot bending is performed at a temperature above the transformation range (above the upper critical). B31.1 and ASME Section III make the break between hot and cold bending at a temperature 100�F (38�C) below the lower critical. B31.3 requires heat treatment after cold bending when (1) specified in the engineering design, (2) the calculated elongation will exceed 5 percent for materials requiring notch toughness properties, and (3) the calculated elongation will exceed 50 percent of the specified minimum elongation indicated in the material specifica- tion for P-No.1 through P-No.6 materials. For hot bending and forming, heat treat- ment is required for all thicknesses of P-Nos.3, 4, 5, 6, and 10A materials. B31.1 and ASME Section III on the other hand require heat treatment after bending or forming in accordance with the postweld heat treatment table of the applicable code for P-No.1 materials with a nominal wall thickness exceeding ³⁄₄ in unless the bending or forming was completed above 1650�F (900�C). All ferritic alloy materials of NPS 4 (DN 100) or larger or with a nominal wall thickness of ¹⁄₂ in or greater which are hot bent or formed must receive an annealing, normalizing and tempering, or a tempering heat treatment to be specified by the designer, or if cold bent or formed, the heat treatment at the required time and temperature cycle specified in the postweld heat treatment table for the material involved. The codes have no requirements for postbending or forming heat treatments of austenitic stainless steels or nonferrous materials. Postwelding Heat Treatment Requirements. Before applying any post-welding heat treatment (PWHT), it should be noted that for work under ASME Section IX, postwelding heat treatment is an essential variable for welding procedure quali- fication. For ferritic materials there are five possible conditions of heat treatment, each requiring separate qualifications. These are: 1. No PWHT 2. PWHT below the lower critical temperature (stress relief) 3. PWHT above the upper critical temperature (normalize or anneal) 4. PWHT above the upper critical temperature, followed by heat treatment below the lower critical temperature (normalize and temper) 5. PWHT between the upper and lower critical temperatures. For other materials, two conditions apply: no PWHT or PWHT within a specified temperature range. Accordingly, for shop work, it may be necessary to qualify welding procedures for several possible heat-treatment situations. For field work only the no heat treatment or stress-relieving situations will normally apply. When required by the codes, heat treatment consists of a stress-relieving opera- tion. Other heat treatments such as annealing, normalizing, or solution heat treat- ment may be applied but are not mandatory. However, the welding procedure must have been qualified for the heat treatment applied. Each code has its own definition regarding governing thicknesses, its own exemp- tions, differing temperature and holding requirements, heating and cooling rates, etc., reflecting the differing concerns and needs of individual industries. The codes are also constantly evolving as the committees obtain and review new data. Accord-

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.311 ingly, the reader should refer to the applicable edition of the code of interest for requirements. At the time of this writing, the following is a comparison of the heat treatment requirements for carbon steel materials. B31.1 requires heat treatment of P-No. 1 Gr.Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in the temperature range of 1100 to 1200�F (600 to 650�C) for 1 h/in (1 h/25 mm) of thickness for the first 2 in (50 mm) plus 15 min for each additional inch over 2 in (50 mm), with a 15-min minimum. Exempted are welds with a nominal thickness of ³⁄₄ in (19 mm) or less, and a 200�F (95�C) preheat must be applied when either of the base metals exceed 1 in (25 mm). The nominal thickness is defined as the lesser of the thickness of the weld or the thicker of the base metals being joined at the weld. The thickness of the weld is further defined as the thicker of the abutting edges in a groove weld, the throat of a fillet weld, the depth of a partial penetration weld, and the depth of the cavity for repair welds. Thickness as it relates to branch welds is a function of the header thickness, the branch thickness, and reinforcing pad thickness. B31.1 also requires controlled heating and cooling at temperatures above 600�F (316�C). The rate shall not exceed 600�F/h (335�C/h) or 600�F/h (335�C/h) divided by one-half the maximum thickness at the weld in inches, whichever is less. Section III requires heat treatment of P-No. 1 materials in the temperature range of 1100 to 1250�F (600 to 675�C) for 30 min when the thickness is ¹⁄₂ in (12.7 mm) or less, for 1 h/in (1 h/25 mm) of thickness for thickness over ¹⁄₂ to 2 in (12.7 mm to 50 mm), and 2 h plus 15 min for each additional inch of thickness over 2 in (50 mm). In this case the thickness is defined as the lesser of (1) the thickness of the weld, (2) the thinner of the pressure retaining parts being joined, or (3) for structural attachment welds, the thickness of the pressure retaining material. ASME Section III exempts P-No. 1 materials in piping systems from mandatory heat treatment based on thickness and carbon content. When the materials being joined are 1¹⁄₂ in (38 mm) or less, the following exemptions apply: (1) a carbon content of 0.30 percent or less with a nominal thickness of 1¹⁄₄ in (32 mm) or less, (2) a carbon content of 0.30 percent or less with a nominal wall thickness of 1¹⁄₂ in (38 mm) when a preheat of 200�F (95�C) is applied, (3) a carbon content over 0.30 percent with a nominal wall thickness of ³⁄₄ in (19 mm) or less, and (4) a carbon content over 0.30 percent and a nominal wall of 1¹⁄₂ in (38 mm) or less when a preheat of 200�F (95�C) is applied. ASME Section III also requires controlled heating and cooling. Above 800�F (430�C) the rate shall not exceed 400�F/h (225�C/h) divided by the maximum thickness in inches but not to exceed 400�F/h (205�C/h). The rate need not be less than 100�F/h (55�C/h). Time and temperature recordings must be made available to the Authorized Nuclear Inspector. B31.5 requires heat treatment of P-No. 1 material greater than ³⁄₄ in (19 mm) in the temperature range of 1100 to 1200�F (600 to 650�C) for 1 h/in (1 h/25 mm) of wall thickness with a 1 h minimum. The governing thickness is the thicker of the abutting edges for butt welds and the throat thickness for fillet socket and seal welds. Controlled heating and cooling rates are specified. B31.3 has similar requirements except that differing thickness definitions are applied to branch, fillet, and socket welds, and there are no specified heating or cooling rates. B31.4 and B31.11 both require stress relieving when the wall thickness exceeds 1¹⁄₄ in (32 mm), or 1¹⁄₂ in (38 mm) if a 200�F (95�C) preheat is applied. No specific temperature is specified. B31.8 on the other hand requires stress relief if the carbon content exceeds 0.32 percent, the carbon equivalent (C �¹⁄₄ Mn) exceeds 0.65 percent, or the wall thickness exceeds 1¹⁄₄ in (32 mm). Carbon steels are to be heat treated at 1100�F (600�C) or higher as stated in the qualified welding procedure.

A.312 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Requirements for postweld heat treatment of many different ferrous alloy steels are given in the various codes. As in the case of the carbon steels, there are variations in requirements from code to code. In the case of welding dissimilar metals, the codes most often specify that the heat treatment which invokes the higher temperature requirement be applied to the weld joint. In applying this criteria many factors should be considered. See the section ‘‘Dissimilar Metals’’ for some options. Another possibility is to take advan- tage of longer-time and lower-temperature heat treatments permitted by some codes. In the end, the best source of information for specific requirements regarding heat treatment is the particular code mandated by law or contract. Where none is invoked, the various codes can be used as guides. Verification Activities—Inspection, Nondestructive Examination, Testing, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control Introduction. Activities involved in verifying that fabrication meets the speci- fied quality level may be broadly categorized as inspection, NDE, testing and QA and QC. The terms inspection, examination, and testing are still often used interchange- ably. The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Codes have begun to establish specific definitions for these terms. The B31 Codes present a mixture of usages, some following the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code lead, while others are less definitive. The reader is directed to the individual codes to see how these terms are used. In general, the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code practice will be followed in this section. Inspection relates to those activities performed by the owner, the owner’s agent, or a third party. All other activities are usually performed by fabricator personnel. The term examination is applied to nondestructive methods of examination, while testing refers to traditional hydrostatic and pneumatic tests for leakage. QA and QC relate to in-plant or on-site programs, whose function is to control the various activities which affect quality. Inspection. Inspection, as used in ASME Section I, III and B31.1 for Boiler External Piping, covers those activities which the authorized inspector (AI) or authorized nuclear inspector (ANI) performs in verifying compliance with the applicable code. The AI or ANI is employed by a third party; is independent of the owner, fabricator, or installer; is an employee of a state or municipality in the United States, a Canadian province, or an insurance company authorized to write boiler insurance; and is qualified by written examination as required by state or provincial rules. In the B31 Piping Codes, inspection is the verification activity performed by the owner or the owner’s agent. Specific requirements for qualification of inspectors are outlined in the individual code sections. The manner in which an inspector verifies compliance is generally left to the discretion of the individual. It may take the form of detailed visual examinations; witnessing of actual operations such as bending, welding, heat treatment, or NDEs; review of records; or combinations thereof. Much relies on the degree of confidence the inspector has in the fabricator’s programs and personnel. B31.3 has mandatory sampling requirements for this activity. Examination Types of Examinations. When used in the various codes, examination refers to the verification work performed by employees of the fabricator, much of which

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.313 falls into the category of NDE. NDEs most often referenced by code and applied to the fabrication and installation of piping components and systems are: Visual Radiographic Ultrasonic Liquid penetrant Magnetic particle Eddy current examination is often used to evaluate the quality of straight lengths of pipe as they are manufactured but is not often used in fabrication activities. Although not referenced by most codes, bubble testing, halogen diode probe testing, or helium pass spectrometer leak testing may be invoked by contract when, in the opinion of the designer, they will contribute to the integrity of the system. While these methods are referred to as leak tests, their methodology is outlined in Article 10 of ASME Section V Nondestructive Examination. Accept-reject criteria and the extent to which the various NDEs are to be applied are in the applicable code. The following are brief descriptions of NDEs as they apply to piping. For much more detailed information the reader is referred to various publications of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT),36 particularly the Nonde- structive Testing Handbooks. 1. Visual examination: Visual examination is probably the oldest and most widely used of all examinations. It is used to ascertain alignment of surfaces, dimensions, surface condition, weld profiles, markings, and evidence of leaks, to name a few. In most instances the manner of conducting a visual examination is left to the discretion of the examiner or inspector, but more recently, written procedures outlining such things as access, lighting, angle of vision, use of direct or remote equipment, and checklists defining the observations required are being used. Visual examination takes place throughout the fabrication cycle along with QA and QC checks. At setup, this would consist of verifying materials, weld procedures, welder qualifications, filler metal, and weld alignment, and on completion of fabrication, such things as terminal dimensions, weld profile, surface condition, and cleanliness. 2. Radiographic examination: When the need for greater integrity in welding must be demonstrated, the most frequently specified examination is radiography. Since the internal condition of the weld can be evaluated, it is referred to as a volumetric examination. Radiographic sources used for examination of piping are usually X-rays or gamma rays from radioactive isotopes. While X-ray equipment is often used, it has limitations in that it often requires multiple exposures for a single joint, and special equipment, such as linear accelerators, are needed for heavier thicknesses. Although X-ray machines produce films with better clarity, they are not as practical in the field because of space limitations and portability. In the field, radioactive isotopes are used almost exclusively because of their portability and case of access. For wall thicknesses up to about 2¹⁄₂ in (63.5 mm) of steel, the most commonly used isotope is iridium 192. Beyond this cobalt 60 is used for wall thickness up to about 7 in (179 mm). Radioactive sources normally used in piping work range in intensity from a few curies up to about 100 curies. Each source decays in intensity in accordance with

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.314 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS its particular half-life. As the intensity decays, longer exposure times are required. Iridium 192 has a half-life of 75 days, while cobalt 60 has a 5.3-year half-life. Radioactive sources have finite dimensions and as a result produce a shadow effect on the film. This is referred to as geometric unsharpness, and it is directly proportional to the source size and inversely proportional to the distance between the source and the film. ASME Section V has established limits for geometric unsharpness. Ideally for pipe, the source is placed inside the pipe and at the center of the weld being examined, with film on the outside surface of the weld, thus permitting one panoramic exposure. Where geometric unsharpness precludes this practice, the source may be placed on the inside on the opposite wall and a portion of the weld is shot. Several exposures will be needed. The source may also be placed outside the pipe and the exposure made through two walls. Again this requires multiple exposures and longer exposure times. See Fig. A6.25. A radiograph is considered acceptable if the required essential hole or wire size FIGURE A6.25 Effect of source size on radiographic technique.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.315 from the image quality indicator is visible on the film. See ASME Section V for information on this subject. 3. Ultrasonic examination: Ultrasonic examination is used in piping for the detec- tion of defects in welds and materials as well as for determining material thickness. A short burst of acoustic energy is transmitted into the piece being examined and echoes reflect from the various boundaries. An analysis of the time and amplitude of the echo provides the examination results. A clock in the equipment acts to initiate and synchronize the other elements. It actuates a pulsar to send a short-duration electrical signal to a transducer, usually at a frequency of 2.5 MHz. The transducer converts the electrical signal to mechani- cal vibration. The vibration as ultrasound passes through a couplant (such as glycer- ine) and through the part at a velocity which is a function of the material. As the sound reflects from various boundaries, it returns to the initiating transducer or sometimes to a second one where it is converted back to an electrical signal which is passed to a receiver amplifier for display on a cathode-ray tube. The horizontal axis of the display relates to time and the vertical axis relates to amplitude. The indication on the extreme left will show the time and amplitude of the signal transmitted from the transducer. Indications to the right will show the time and degree of reflection from various boundaries or internal discontinuities. The ability of an ultrasonic examination to detect discontinuities depends a great deal on the part geometry and defect orientation. If the plane of the defect is normal to the sound beam, it will act as a reflecting surface. If it is parallel to the sound beam, it may not present a reflecting surface and accordingly may not show on the oscilloscope. Therefore, the search technique must be carefully chosen to assure that it will cover all possible defect orientations. The most serious defect in a pipe butt weld is that which is oriented in the radial direction. The most commonly used technique for detecting such defects is the shear wave search. In this procedure, the transducer is located to one side of the weld at an angle to the pipe surface. The angle is maintained by a lucite block which transmits the sound from the transducer into the pipe. The sound will travel at an angle through the pipe and weld. Being at an angle, it will reflect from the pipe surfaces until it is attenuated. Any surface which is normal to the beam, however, will reflect a portion of the sound back to the transducer and show as an indication on the oscilloscope. See Fig. A6.26. If the beam angle and the material thickness are known, the reflecting surface can be located and evaluated. Prior to and periodically during each search, the equipment is calibrated against artificial defects of known size and orientation in a calibration block. The block must be representative of the material being searched (i.e., an acoustically similar material, with appropriate thickness, outside contour, surface finish, and heat- treated condition). A variation of ultrasonic examination can be used to measure material thickness. If the speed of sound within the material is known, the time it takes for the signal to traverse the thickness and return can be converted to a thickness measurement. 4. Liquid penetrant examination: Penetrant-type examinations are suitable for surface examinations only but are very sensitive. They require a fairly smooth surface, since surface irregularities such as grinding mark indications can be confused with defect indications. The surface to be examined is thoroughly cleaned with a solvent and then coated with a penetrating-type fluid. Sufficient time is allowed to permit the fluid to penetrate into surface discontinuities. The excess penetrant is removed by wiping with cloths until all evidence of the penetrant is removed. A developer which acts somewhat like a blotter is then applied to the surface. This

A.316 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A6.26 Ultrasonic shear wave search. (a) Search arrangement; (b) oscilloscope. draws the penetrant out of the discontinuity, and it will appear on the surface as an indication. Obviously, the success of the examination depends on the visibility of the indication. To enhance this, the penetrant contains colored dyes which can be seen under normal light, or fluorescent dyes which are viewed under ultraviolet light. The most common case is a red dye penetrant with a white developer. 5. Magnetic particle examination: Magnetic particle examination is essentially a surface-type examination, although some imperfections just below the surface are detectable. This type of examination is limited to materials which can be magnetized (paramagnetic materials), since it relies on the lines of force within a magnetic field. The item to be examined is subjected to a current which will produce magnetic lines of force within the item. The surface is then sprayed with a fine iron powder. The powder will align itself with the lines of force. Any discontinuity normal to the lines of force will produce a leakage field around it and a consequent buildup of powder which will pinpoint the defect. The examination must be repeated at 90�to detect discontinuities which were parallel to the original field. There are a great many variations of magnetic particle examination depending on the manner in which the field is applied and whether the particles are wet or dry and fluorescent or colored. Methodology. The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel, B31.1 and B31.3, require certain NDEs to be performed in accordance with the methods described in ASME Section V Nondestructive Examination. The pipeline codes, B31.4, B31.8, and B31.11, refer to API-1104 for Radiographic Procedures. In some cases, particularly in visual examination, requirements are given but no specific methodology is stated. In others, alternative parameters or qualification requirements are given. The spe- cific requirements of the individual codes should be consulted. Qualification Requirements. Qualification of procedures and personnel used in NDEs are required by most codes. When ASME Section V or API-1104 are invoked by the referencing code, a written procedure is required and it must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the AI, ANI, owner, or owner’s agent, whichever is applicable. Similarly personnel who perform NDEs must be trained, qualified, and certified. The most frequently invoked qualification document is SNT-TC-1A37; it is also accepted by B31.1 for qualification of personnel performing visual examinations. Some codes permit alternatives, such as AWS-QC-1.38

The applicable code will define the extent of examina- tion required for piping systems under its coverage. The degree of examination and the examination method and alternatives are a function of the degree of hazard which might be expected to occur in the event of failure. Pressure, temperature, toxicity of the fluid, and release of radioactive substances are some of the considera- tions. Added layers of examinations may be required as the perceived hazard in- creases. Accept-Reject Criteria. The applicable code will also define the items to be examined and the accept-reject criteria to be applied. Table A6.9 shows the accep- tance standards applicable to the visual examination of butt welds under B31.1. Other piping codes have similar but not necessarily identical criteria. Table A6.10 shows acceptance standards for radiographic examination. Indica- tions interpreted as cracks, incomplete penetration, or lack of fusion are not permit- ted. Porosity and elongated indications are kept within certain limits. The acceptance standards for ultrasonic examination are similar.

Both magnetic particle and liquid penetrant examinations have identical limits. See Table A6.11 Other types of NDEs, such as acoustic emission, bubble testing, and mass spec- trometer testing, are not required by the various codes. They can be invoked by contract and the acceptance standards must be a matter of agreement between the contracting parties. Testing. All of the piping codes outline some type of pressure test to determine leak tightness. Since the completed piping system is usually subjected to some type of test in the field after installation, shop testing of subassemblies is infrequent. In those cases where the assembly cannot be field tested, where welds in the assembly will not be exposed for examination during the field test, and in other special situations, shop testing may be required. Shop testing must meet all of the require- ments for field testing. See the section ‘‘Installation’’ for particulars. Quality Assurance and Quality Control. ASME Section III has very specific requirements for QA programs. ASME Section I has requirements for QC pro- grams. The B31 Piping Codes do not require any formal written program at this time. Refer to these codes for detailed information on this subject. Cleaning and Packaging. Cleanliness of piping subassemblies is a matter of agreement between the fabricator and purchaser. As a minimum the fabricator will clean the inside of the subassembly of loose scale, weld spatter, machining chips, etc., usually with jets of compressed air. For those systems which require a greater degree of cleanliness several options are available. For specific information refer to PFI Standard ES-5 ‘‘Cleaning of Fabricated Pipe.’’39 See also the following specifications published by the Steel Structures Painting Council:40 SSPC—SP 2 Hand Tool Cleaning SSPC—SP 3 Power Tool Cleaning SSPC—SP 6 Commercial Blast Cleaning SSPC—SP 8 Pickling SSPC—SP 10 Near-white Blast Cleaning For ferritic steels the inside surfaces may be cleaned by turbinizing to remove loosely adhering mill scale and heavy rust. Wire brushing and grinding may also be employed for removal of more tightly adhering scale, rust, etc.; however, the most effective method for removal of tight scale is blasting with sand, shot, or grit.

*Source: piping-handbook*

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.319 For guidance on blasting methods and degrees of cleanliness refer to PFI Standard ES-29 ‘‘Abrasive Blast Cleaning of Ferritic Piping Materials.’’41 Pickling is an equally effective method of cleaning. It is most often used for cleaning large quantities of straight tubes prior to fabrication or small-size (about NPS 4) subassemblies where blasting is not as effective. Its application is limited by the availability and size of pickling tanks. A hot solution of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is most commonly used, although cold hydrochloric acid (HCl) is also recommended. See SSPC—SP 8 ‘‘Pickling.’’ For the 9Cr-1Mo-V materials, aluminum-oxide or silicon-carbide grit, sand or vapor blasting is preferred. Steel shot or grit which has been previously used to clean iron-bearing materials should be avoided. Acid pickling should also be avoided since damaging hydrogen embrittlement may occur. Austenitic stainless steels normally do not require cleaning except for a degreas- ing with solvent-saturated cloths to remove traces of greases or cutting oils. Subas- semblies which have been heated for bending or which have been given a carbide solution heat treatment will have a tightly adhering chromic oxide scale. Pickling and passivating in a solution of hydrofluoric and nitric acid will remove the scale and passivate the exposed surface. Here again, the equipment for pickling may limit the size of the subassembly. See ASTM A 380 published by the American Society for Testing Materials.42 Blasting may also be used, but new silica sand or aluminum-oxide grit is required. Sand or grit previously used on ferritic pipe will contaminate the pipe surface with iron particles, and it will subsequently rust. The blasted surface should be treated with a solution of nitric acid to passivate the surface. For extreme cleanliness, steam degreasing and rinsing with demineralized water may be employed. The external surfaces of pipe may be left as is, painted, or otherwise preserved. See PFI Standard ES-34 ‘‘Painting of Fabricated Piping.’’43 Depending on the need for maintaining rust-free interior surfaces, the pipe inside diameter may be coated with different preservatives, or desiccants may be employed during shipping and storage. For shipping, the ends of subassemblies are equipped with some type of end protection to preclude damage to weld end bevels or flange faces during shipment and field handling. See PFI Standard ES-31 ‘‘Standard for Protection of Ends of Fabricated Piping Assemblies.’’44 During shop operations, it is common practice to move piping assemblies with overhead or floor cranes, usually with chain or wire rope slings. For austenitic stainless steels and nonferrous materials which could be damaged or contaminated, use of nylon slings is recommended. INSTALLATION Drawings Drawings used for piping system installation may vary greatly. Often orthographic projections of the building showing several systems or single systems, depending on complexity, are used. In many cases single or multiple isometric drawings of a single system are used. These of course are not to scale but are convenient for planning, progress recording, or record keeping when required by quality programs. In all cases where prefabricated subassemblies are being erected, these drawings

A.320 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS will have been marked up to show the locations and mark numbers of the individual subassemblies, the location and designations of field welds, and the locations and markings of hangers. Erection Planning Planning is vitally important in installing a piping system. Many factors must be considered, among them accessibility to the building location, coordination with other work, availability and accessibility of suitable welding and heat treatment equipment, availability and qualification of welders and welding procedures, rigging, scaffolding, and availability of terminal equipment. Each of the system components should also be carefully checked to assure correctness. Valves and other specialty items in particular should be checked to assure they are marked with flow arrows, that the handwheels or motor operators are properly oriented, and that the material to be welded is compatible with the material of the piping. Special valves for use in carbon steel systems are sometimes furnished as 5 percent chrome material, and thermowells are often not of the same chemical composition as the pipe. This may not be apparent from the drawings. Such a preliminary check will indicate the need for alternate welding procedures and preclude problems later. The location of the work and accessibility to it should be viewed. It may not be possible to install an overly long subassembly after other equipment or building structure is in place. A common practice in the power field is to have large, heavy assemblies often found in the main steam and reheat lines of large central stations erected with the structure. In other cases, a preliminary review may show interfer- ences from an existing structure, cable trays, ducts, or other piping which are not apparent from the drawings. The locations of the terminal points on equipment should be checked to assure that they are correct. The type, size, rating, or weld preparation of the connection should be checked to assure that it will match the piping. Solutions to any problems can be devised with the designer before work starts. The ideal way to begin erection is to start at some major piece of equipment or at a header with multiple outlets. Install the permanent hangers if possible. If these are to be welded to the structure, some prudence should be exercised, since the final location of the line may warrant some small relocation to assure that the hanger is properly oriented relative to the piping in its final position. Obviously a certain number of temporary supports will be needed. Welding of temporary sup- ports to the building structure or to the piping itself should be avoided or used only with the approval of the responsible engineers. Variable spring and constant- support-type hangers should normally be installed with locking pins in place, assur- ing that they function as a rigid support during the erection cycle. Where welded attachments to the pipe are involved, it is preferred that they be installed in the shop as part of the subassembly. If possible, the major components of the system should be erected in their approximate final position prior to the start of any welding. This will reveal any unusually large discrepancies which may result from equipment mislocation, fabrica- tion error, or tolerance accumulations. Adjustments or corrections can then be decided upon. Long, multiplane systems can absorb considerable tolerance accumu- lation without the need to modify any part. Short, rigid systems may not be able to accommodate any tolerance accumulation, and it may be necessary to rework one or more parts.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.321 Cold Spring Both the B31.1 and B31.3 Codes address cold springing in detail. Cold spring is the intentional stressing and elastic deformation of the piping system during the erection cycle to permit the system to attain more favorable reactions and stresses in the operating condition. The usual procedure is to fabricate the system dimensions short by an amount equal to some percentage of the calculated expansion value in each direction. The system is then erected with a gap at some final closure weld, equal to the ‘‘cut shorts’’ in each direction. Forces and moments are then applied to both ends as necessary to bring the final joint into alignment. Once this is done, it is usually necessary to provide anchors on both sides of the joint to preserve alignment during welding, postweld heat treatment, and final examination. When the weld is completed and the restraining forces are removed, the resulting reactions are ab- sorbed by the terminal points, and the line is in a state of stress. During start-up the line expands as the temperature increases, and the levels of stress and terminal reactions resulting from the initial cold spring will decrease. For the 100 percent cold sprung condition, the reactions and stress will be maximum in the cold condition and theoretically zero in the hot condition. It should be borne in mind that it is very difficult to assure that a perfect cold spring has been attained and for this reason the codes do not permit full credit in the flexibility calculations. Also remember that lines operating in the creep range will ultimately attain the fully relaxed condition. Cold spring merely helps it get there faster. Cold spring was historically applied to high-temperature systems such as main steam and hot reheat lines in central power stations, but this practice is not as prevalent anymore. For those involved with the repair of lines which have been cold sprung, or which have achieved some degree of creep, caution should be exercised when cutting into such lines since the line will be in a state of stress when cold. The line should be anchored on either side of the proposed cut to prevent a possible accident. Joint Alignment In aligning weld joints for field welding it may be necessary to compromise between a perfect weld fit-up and the location of the opposite (downstream) end of the assembly. The weld bevel may not be perfectly square with the longitudinal axis of the assembly. Even a ¹⁄₃₂-in (0.8 mm) deviation across the face of the weld bevel can result in an unacceptable deviation from the required downstream location if the joint is aligned as perfectly as possible. Often such a small gap can be tolerated in the welding. If, in order to maintain the downstream location, the gap at the joint is excessive, the joint should be disassembled, and the land filed or ground as needed to attain the required alignment of the weld joint while still maintaining the required downstream position. Flanged connections should be made up hand- tight so that advantage can be taken of the bolt-hole clearances to translate or rotate the assembly for better alignment of downstream connections. Weld shrinkage of field welds may or may not be important in field assembly. In long flexible systems, they may be ignored. For more closely coupled systems, particularly those using GTAW root-pass welding, this factor should be considered. The degree of longitudinal shrinkage across a weld varies with welding process, heat input, thickness, and weld joint detail. See the section ‘‘Layout, Assembly, and Preparation for Welding.’’ In extreme cases closure pieces may be used. Here, the system is completed except for the final piece. A dummy assembly is then

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.322 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS fabricated in place and the closure assembly is fabricated to match the dimensions of the dummy assembly with weld shrinkage of the final welds taken into account. Cutting, Bending, Welding, Heat Treatment, and Examination Cutting, bending, and welding operations in the field parallel those used in the shop. See the section ‘‘Fabrication.’’ Mechanical and oxyfuel gas cutting are most commonly used in the field. Plasma cutting may occasionally be used. Bending, if used at all, is limited to small-diameter piping using relatively simple bending equipment at ambient temperatures. Occasionally in order to correct for misalignment, larger-diameter ferritic piping is bent at temperatures below the lower critical. Please note that this procedure is limited to ferritic materials. Any application of heat to austenitic materials will result in sensitization and loss of corrosion properties. See the section ‘‘Bending.’’ For smaller pipe sizes, torches may be used to supply heat, but for larger, heavier-wall materials and where better temperature control is warranted, heat may be applied by induction or resistance heating units in the same manner as local stress relieving. See the section ‘‘Local Heat Treatment.’’ The heating units are applied to the section of the pipe to be bent. The section of the line upstream of the area to be bent should be anchored to preclude translation or rotation of the installed portion of the line. The anchor should preferably be not more than one or two pipe diameters from the area to be heated. Once the bend area has attained the required temperature, a bending force can be applied on the downstream leg of the pipe until the required bend arc has been obtained. Since most ferritic materials still have reasonably high yield strengths even at lower critical temperatures, care should be exercised. Large bending forces may damage the building structure or crack the line being bent. Apply a reasonable force for the conditions and allow the imposed stress in the bend arc to be relieved by the heat. Then repeat. Progress in this fashion until the required bend is accomplished. Some small amount of overbending may be required to offset the deflection which will occur in the unheated section of pipe between the heated arc and the pulling device. When the bend is completed and allowed to cool, all restraints may then be removed. Little if any force should be needed to align the downstream joint; otherwise additional bending may be needed to further correct the situation. No further heat treatment of the bend arc is needed since the temperatures applied in this bending method are below the lower critical temperature. Corrections to lines with large section modulus or where the required bend arc is large should preferably be made in a shop since better controls can be exercised. Field welding is more often than not in a fixed position. Welders should be qualified in the 6G position since this qualifies for all positions. Welding will be done using SMAW, GMAW, FCAW, and GTAW. Some welding processes can be automated using orbital welding techniques. Such practice can result in fewer repairs, provided the bevels and alignment are within tolerance and the welding parameters are carefully selected. Field postweld heat treatment also follows the practices outlined in the section ‘‘Heat Treatment’’ for local stress-relieving of ferritic materials. This usually involves induction or resistance heating units with recording devices. For small pipe welds, torch heating using temperature-sensitive crayons to control temperature is some- times used. Exothermic heating to stress-relieve welds is still used on occasion for outdoor applications where heating rates are not required to be controlled.

*Source: piping-handbook*

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.323 Exothermic materials are preformed to pipe contour and sized to reflect the wall thickness and desired stress-relieving temperature. They are placed around the weld and ignited, attaining temperature in 5 or 10 min. The actual maximum temperature attained may vary. NDE in the field will follow the practices outlined in the section ‘‘Verification Activities.’’ Radiography is usually limited to radioactive isotopes, although occa- sionally X-ray equipment may find a use. Most surface examination is conducted using liquid-penetrant methods, since magnetic particle equipment is not as conve- nient in the field. Ultrasonics are used for thickness verification and in certain situations as an alternative to radiography of welds when permitted by the govern- ing code. Mechanical Joints Threaded joints probably represent the oldest method of joining piping systems. The dimensional standards for taper pipe threads are given in ASME B1.20.1.45 This document gives all required dimensions including number of threads per inch, pitch diameter, and normal engagement lengths for all pipe diameters. Thread cutting should be regarded as a precise machining operation. A typical thread- ing die is shown on Fig. A6.27. For steel pipe the lip angle should be about 25�, but for brass it should be much smaller. Improper lip angle results in rough or torn threads. Since pipe threads are not perfect, joint compounds are used to provide leak tightness. The compounds selected, of course, should be compati- ble with the fluid carried and should be evaluated for possible detrimental ef- fects on system components. Manufac- turers’ recommendations should be fol- lowed. FIGURE A6.27 Threading die. Where the presence of a joint com- pound is undesirable, dryseal pipe threads in accordance with ASME B1.20.346 may be employed. These are primarily found in hydraulic and pneumatic control lines and instruments. Flanged joints are most often used where disassembly for maintenance is desired. A great deal of information regarding the selection of flange types, flange tolerances, facings and gasketing, and bolting is found in B16.5. The limitations regarding cast- iron-to-steel flanges, as well as gasket and bolting selection, should be carefully observed. The governing code will usually have further requirements. Gasket surfaces should be carefully cleaned and inspected prior to making up the joint. Damaged or pitted surfaces may leak. Appropriate gaskets and bolting must be used. The flange contact surfaces should be aligned perfectly parallel to each other. Attempting to correct any angular deviation perpendicular to the flange faces while making up the joint may result in overstressing a portion of the bolts and subsequent leakage. The proper gasket should be inserted making sure that it is centered properly on the contact surfaces. Bolts should be tightened hand-tight. If necessary for alignment elsewhere, advantage may be taken of the bolt hole

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.324 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS tolerances to translate or rotate in the plane of the flanges. In no case should rotation perpendicular to the flange faces be attempted. When the assembly is in its final location, bolts should be made up wrench-tight in a staggered sequence. The bolt loading should exert a compressive force of about twice that generated by the internal pressure to compensate not only for internal pressure but for any bending loads which may be imposed on the flange pair during operation. For a greater guarantee against leakage, torque wrenches may be employed to load each bolt or stud to some predetermined value. Care should be exercised to preclude loading beyond the yield point of the bolting. In other cases, special studs that have had the ends ground to permit micrometer measurement of stud elongation may be used. Flange pairs which are to be insulated should be carefully selected since the effective length of the stud or bolt will expand to a greater degree than the flange thicknesses, and leakage will occur. Thread lubricants should be used, particularly in high-temperature service to permit easier assembly and disassembly for mainte- nance. FIGURE A6.28 Compression sleeve (Dresser) coupling for plain- end cast-iron or steel pipe. There are a great variety of mechanical joints used primarily for buried cast- iron pipelines carrying water or low-pressure gas. They are primarily of the bell and spigot type with variations involving the use of bolted glands, screw-type glands, and various types of gasketing. The reader is referred to AWWA Standards C 111,47 C 150,48 and C 600,49 and to catalogs for proprietary types. For reinforced concrete pipe, AWWA Standards C 300,50 C 301,51 and C 302,52 should be consulted. Compres- sion-sleeve couplings such as the Dresser coupling (see Fig. A6.28) and the Victualic coupling (see Fig. A6.29) are widely used for above- and below-ground services, both with cast-iron and steel pipe. Consult the manufacturers’ catalogs for more information. Refer to Chap. A9 of this handbook.

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF PIPING SYSTEMS A.325 Tubing Copper, aluminum, steel, and stainless-steel tubing are frequently used in hydraulic, pneumatic, and sampling systems. Installation is most often concerned with protec- tion of such materials from damage, since they are often associated with control systems. The manner of pro- tection is left to the designer’s judg- ment. Lighter wall tubing is often bent using small compression-type benders. Tubing is joined to itself and to pipe-size fitting and components with a variety of propri- etary tubing fittings which are described in Chap. A2. Some heavier-wall stain- less-steel tubing is welded using specially designed socket welding fittings. GTAW welding with filler metal added is used FIGURE A6.29 Victualic coupling for for such applications. grooved-end cast-iron or steel pipe. Pipe Supports This section offers some thoughts on the installation of piping supports. The design, manufacture, and influence of supports on the system flexibility are outlined in Chaps. B4 and B5 of this book. As pointed out earlier, economics and efficiency dictate that it is preferable to install the permanent supports for a system as the first step, thus minimizing the need for temporary supports. In so doing considerable judgment should be exercised, since there can be minor variations between the as-designed and as-installed line location. Resilient and constant-effort support should be locked with stops to pre- clude change in supporting effort as the line is being installed. Only after the line has been completely welded, tested, and insulated should the stops be removed. Once removed, the resilient and constant-effort supports should be carefully ad- justed to their ‘‘cold’’ positions. This may take several iterations, since adjustment of any one will change the loading on the adjacent ones. Systems with multiple constant-effort supports can be especially troublesome. Since the support design is most often based on theoretical values of weight of the pipe, insulation, and the fluid, there will be some difference between the actual and calculated supporting effort. Where rigid supports are involved, this variation will be taken up automati- cally. Where a system is designed with multiple resilient or constant-effort supports, every effort should be made to incorporate one or more rigid supports in the design to absorb the variation between actual and theoretical loads. Otherwise it may be necessary, with the approval of the designer, to modify the spring load-carrying settings. As the line goes to operating temperature, it should be carefully observed to assure that there are no unforeseen interferences with its required expansion, partic- ularly at nearby structures, floor sleeves, or adjacent lines or by restrained branch connections. Some modification may be required to assure free expansion of the line. All resilient supports and constant-effort supports should be checked during initial start-up to assure that they are functioning properly, and after the line has

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.326 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS been at operating temperature for several hours, they should be checked to verify that they are in the required ‘‘hot’’ operating condition. It may be necessary to readjust some units to match the calculated ‘‘hot’’ loading. These settings should be checked on a regular basis for the first few weeks of service, particularly in systems operating in the creep range, since the temperature will begin to relieve locked-in construction stresses, and the line may choose a different, more relaxed location. Readjustments may be required. If after some time in service, the resilient and constant-effort supports still require significant adjustment (i.e., the system cannot be balanced), a complete review of the flexibility analysis, expansion calcula- tions, weight calculations, hanger, design, and installation procedures should be made to determine the cause. Resilient and constant-effort support units which are not functioning in the spring range (i.e., they have become ‘‘solid’’ or ‘‘loose’’) may impose undesirably high stresses in the line if they are not corrected, which can lead to premature failure or significantly reduced system life. Leak Testing At one time, complex shapes were pressure-tested to determine their suitability for the service intended. This involved stressing the component to a point above service stresses, but below bursting stress, and was referred to as a pressure test. Currently most codes require some type of test to determine leak tightness rather than service suitability. The most common method of leak testing for piping systems is the hydrostatic test. Usually this involves water at ambient temperature as the test medium. B31.1 requires that the system be pressurized to 1.5 times the design pressure, ASME III, to 1.25 times the design pressure, and B31.3 requires a test pressure of 1.5 times the design pressure adjusted by the ratio of the allowable stress at test temperature divided by the allowable stress at operating temperature. In each case, however, the test pressure of unisolated equipment or some function of the yield stress of the line material may be a limiting factor. See the applicable code for particulars. The line must be held at test pressure for at least 10 min, but may be reduced as permitted in the applicable code until the examination for leakage is complete. Depending on the specific situation, alternative test fluids may be employed. As an example, in a liquid sodium system, where water could be very hazardous, or in cases where the possibility of freezing exists, a hydrocarbon or other fluid might be used. In instances where water or other liquids are unacceptable, or where supports may not be adequate to carry the added weight of water, pneumatic tests may be performed. Pneumatic tests are potentially more dangerous than hydrostatic tests, and extreme care should be exercised. B31.1 and ASME III require the pneumatic test be performed at not less than 1.2 times the design pressure, while B31.3 limits the test to 1.1 times design. In each case, the limits regarding equipment and yield strength previously cited for hydrostatic tests also apply. Prior to the test a detailed review of the section of the line to be tested should be made with the following in mind: 1. Temporary supports for those sections where the permanent supports were not designed to take the additional weight of the test fluid. 2. Isolation or restraints on expansion joints. 3. Isolation of equipment or valves which may be overstressed at test pressure.

Location of vents and drains. 6. Location of a relief valve to preclude excessive overpressure due to possible thermal expansion of the test fluid. 7. Consideration of the probable ambient test temperature relative to the expected brittle fracture toughness of the system materials. Heating the water may be a solution. 8. Alternative test fluid. 9. Accessibility to the weld joints for inspection. Some codes require that the weld joints be left exposed until after the test. 10. Assurance that no part of the system will exceed 90 percent of its yield strength. It is advisable to prepare a written procedure outlining the scope and boundaries of each test to assure that it is performed in a safe manner. The codes vary a bit on the required test pressures, time at test pressure, pressure during inspection for leakage, and whether alternative tests may be performed. It is advisable to look at each one specifically. For more details, refer to Chap. B14 of this handbook. REFERENCES 1.

CHAPTER A7 BOLTED JOINTS Gordon Britton President, INTEGRA Technologies Limited Sarnia, Ontario, Canada INTRODUCTION While other chapters of the Piping Handbook deal with the pressure integrity of the piping system, this chapter deals with managing the leak integrity of bolted flanged systems. It covers the main elements of a bolted joint system to provide an understanding of the bolted joint connection and the science of joint sealing. This chapter focuses exclusively on bolted joints subjected to internal pressures. While integrity of mechanical (structural) joints are also critical, they are not covered in this book. Oil, gas, and power plants and other process industries are under constant pressure to work their plants at maximum design limitations and for longer periods. The bolted joint is often regarded as the weak link in the plant’s pressure envelope. Whether a pipe flange, heat exchanger, reactor manway, or valve bonnet, the joint integrity relies not only on the mechanical design of the flange and its components, but also on its condition, maintenance, and assembly. Plant personnel are looking for equipment to achieve leak-free joints with reduced shutdown periods while increasing the time between shutdowns. Similarly, flanged joints in other piping and distribution systems found throughout industrial, commercial, and residential facilities are required to maintain their structural integrity and leak tightness. Several standards have been written to enable designers to design bolted joints. Compliance to the requirements of these standards ensures mechanical integrity of bolted joints. However, these standards do not provide adequate and effective requirements or guidelines to assure leak integrity of flanged joints. To achieve leak integrity, a broader view of the bolted flange joint as a system must be adopted. Ideally, a process is to be followed that manages the key elements of the bolted system, which allows the design potential of the bolted joint to be realized and helps in achieving continued leak-free operation. This chapter reviews the process required to achieve flange-joint integrity. A.331

A.332 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS COST OF A LEAK Some believe leaking flanges are normal and leaks cannot be prevented. Some also hold similar views about health and safety. Safety professionals now know that accidents can be prevented and that the goal of zero accidents is achievable. The goal of zero leaks is also achievable. Leaks are still very commonplace. A thorough survey throughout North American industry, performed by Pressure Vessel Re- search Council (PVRC), concluded that the average plant experiences 180 leaks per year. A breakdown of the severity of these leaks is shown in Fig. A7.1. FIGURE A7.1 Industry leak study (PVRC Study, July 1985). In a manner similar to accident ratio statistics, there is a relationship between minor, serious, and other dangerous events. All events represent failure in control. Failures in control that result in leaks cost industry millions of dollars yearly due to: ●Emission ●Pollution, spills ●Rework ●Leak sealing ●Fires ●Lost product ●Late schedules ●Forced shut downs—production losses Control is the issue. Leaks are controllable. Control is achieved by implementa- tion of a Flange Joint Integrity program. Joint Integrity is a control program that becomes an integral part of a plant’s safety and reliability.

BOLTED JOINTS A.333 THE PROCESS OF JOINT INTEGRITY To assist in managing a process, ask yourself the following questions: why, what, who, and how? Why do we need a Flange Joint Integrity program? This was addressed in the previous section, ‘‘Cost of a Leak.’’ The stakes are enormous. A Flange Joint Integrity program will help improve plant safety and reliability while reducing its environmental impact. What do we need to control? The operating environment, the components, and assembly all need to be controlled. Who do we need to control? The designers, field operatives, and supervisors. How do we control? Train personnel to required competency. Design compo- nents using latest engineering standards. Develop best practices for assembly and maintenance. Implement a quality assurance program that provides traceability and ensures compliance to specifications. There are over 120 variables that affect flange joint integrity. These can be controlled through the following categories: ●Environment (internal and external) ●Components ●Assembly The internal environment outlines the design and operating conditions of temper- ature, pressure, and fluid. With the external environment, consideration is given to location of the flange, whether it is operating in air or sub-sea, and externally applied piping loads. An understanding of the environment is crucial to the design and selection of the appropriate components with the correct assembly methods. The components include the most appropriately designed and selected flange, gasket, and bolting, commensurate with the risk dictated by the environment. Assembly includes checking the condition of the components and proceeding according to established procedures. Proper assembly requires that ●Flange faces meet the standards ●Gasket-seating stress is achieved ●Bolts, nuts, and gaskets are free of defects ●Appropriate lubrication is used Execution requires trained, competent people using the correct tools and follow- ing procedures. The steps in the joint integrity process are shown in Fig. A7.2. FLANGE JOINT COMPONENTS Flanges There are numerous types of flanges available. The type and material of flanges is dependent on the service environment. The service environment is specified in the Piping and Instrumentation Drawing (P&ID) and other design documents. Refer

Pipe with Threaded Flanges C-207 Steel Pipe Flanges API Specifications Spec 6A-96 Specification for Wellhead and Christ- mas Tree Equipment The two most commonly used flange standards for process and utilities pipework are ASME B16.5 and BS 1560 (British Standards). API 6A (American Petroleum Institute) specifies flanges for wellhead and Christmas tree equipment. Less common flange standards which may be encountered are flanges for metric or DIN standards. Refer to Chap. A4 for other codes and standards. Flange-End Connection The flange-end connection defines the way in which it is attached to the pipe. The following are commonly available standard flange end types: Weld-Neck (WN) Flange. Weld-neck flanges are distinguished from other types by their long, tapered hub and gentle transition to the region where the WN flange is butt-welded to the pipe. The long, tapered hub provides an important reinforcement of the flange, increasing its strength and resistance to dishing. WN flanges are typically used on arduous duties involving high pressures or hazard- ous fluids. The butt-weld may be examined by radiography or ultrasonic inspection. Usually, the butt-welds are subject to visual, surface, or volumetric examinations, or a combi- nation thereof, depending on the requirements of the code of construction for piping or a component. There is, therefore, a high degree of reliability in the integrity of the weld. A butt-weld also has good fatigue performance, and its presence does not induce high local stresses in the pipework. Socket-Weld (SW) Flange. Socket-weld flanges are often used on hazardous duties involving high pressure but are limited to a nominal pipe size NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller. The pipe is fillet-welded to the hub of the SW flange. Radiography is not practical on the fillet weld; therefore correct fitting and welding is crucial. The fillet weld may be inspected by surface examination, magnetic particle (MP), or liquid penetrant (PT) examination methods. Slip-on Flanges. Slip-on flanges are preferred to weld-neck flanges by many users because of their initial low cost and ease of installation. Their calculated strength under internal pressure is about two-thirds of that of weld-neck flanges. They are typically used on low-pressure, low-hazard services such as fire water, cooling water, and other services. The pipe is ‘‘double-welded’’ to both the hub and the bore of the flange, but, again, radiography is not practical. MP, PT, or visual examination is used to check the integrity of the weld. When specified, the slip-on flanges are used on pipe sizes greater than NPS 2¹⁄₂ (DN 65). Composite Lap-Joint Flange. This type of flanged joint is typically found on high alloy pipe work. It is composed of a hub, or ‘‘stub end,’’ welded to the pipe and a

A.336 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS backing flange, or lapped flange, which is used to bolt the joint together. An alloy hub with a galvanized steel backing flange is cheaper than a complete alloy flange. The flange has a raised face, and sealing is achieved with a flat ring gasket. Swivel-Ring Flange. As with the composite lap-joint flange, a hub will be butt- welded to the pipe. A swivel ring sits over the hub and allows the joint to be bolted together. Swivel-ring flanges are normally found on sub–sea services where the swivel ring facilitates flange alignment. The flange is then sealed using a ring-type joint (RTJ) metal gasket. Blind Flange. Blind flanges are used to blank off the ends of piping, valves, and pressure vessel openings. From the standpoint of internal pressure and bolt loading, blind flanges, particularly in the larger sizes, are the most highly stressed of all the standard flanges. However, since the maximum stresses in a blind flange are bending stresses at the center, they can be safely permitted to be stressed more than other types of flanges. These common flange types are shown in Fig. A7.3. Flange Faces There are five types of flange faces commonly found. The surface finish of the faces are specified in the flange standards quoted above. Raised Face (RF). The raised face is the most common facing employed with bronze, ductile iron, and steel flanges. The RF is ¹⁄₁₆-in high for Class 150 and Class 300 flanges and ¹⁄₄-in high for all pressure classes, higher than Class 300. The facing on a RF flange has a concentric or phonographic groove with a controlled surface finish. Sealing is achieved by compressing a flat, soft, or semimetallic gasket between mating flanges in contact with the raised face portion of the flange. Ring-Type Joint (RTJ). This type is typically used in the most severe duties, for example, in high-pressure-gas pipe work. Ring-type metal gaskets must be used on this type of flange facing. RTJ for API 6A Type 6B, BS 1560 and ASME B16.5 Flanges The seal is made by plastic deformation of the RTJ gasket into the groove in the flange, resulting in intimate metal-to-metal contact between the gasket and the flange groove. The faces of the two opposing flange faces do not come into contact because a gap is maintained by the presence of the gasket. Such RTJ flanges will normally have raised faces, but flat faces may also be used or specified. RTJ for API 6A Type 6BX Flanges API 6A Type 6BX flanges have raised faces. These flanges incorporate special metal ring joint gaskets. The pitch diameter of the ring is slightly greater than the pitch diameter of the flange groove. This factor preloads the gasket and creates a pressure-energized seal. A Type 6BX flange joint that does not achieve face-to-face contact will not seal and, therefore, must not be put into service. Flat Face (FF). Flat-face flanges are a variant of raised face flanges. Sealing is achieved by compression of a flat nonmetallic gasket (very rarely a flat metallic

A.338 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS gasket) between the grooved surfaces of the mating FF flanges. The gasket fits over the entire face of the flange. FF flanges are normally used on the least arduous of duties, such as low pressure water piping having Class 125 and Class 250 flanges and flanged valves and fittings. In this case the large gasket contact area spreads the flange loading and reduces flange stresses. Note: Both ASME B16.5 and BS 1560 specify flat face flanges and raised face flanges as well as RTJ flanges. API 6A is specific to RTJ flanges only. Male and Female Facings. The female face is ³⁄₁₆-in deep, the male face is ¹⁄₄-in high, and both are smooth finished. The outer diameter of the female face acts to locate and retain the gasket. Custom male and female facings are commonly found on the heat exchanger shell to channel and cover flanges. Tongue-and-Groove Facings. Tongue-and-groove facings are standardized in both large and small types. They differ from male-and-female in that the inside diameters of the tongue-and-groove do not extend into the flange base, thus retaining the gasket on its inner and outer diameter. These are commonly found on pump covers and valve bonnets. Flange Specification and Identification A flange is specified by the following information: Type and Facing. The flange is specified according to whether it is, for example, ‘‘weld-neck RTJ’’ or ‘‘socket-weld RF.’’ Ring joint facing and RTJ gasket dimen- sions for ASME B16.5 are shown in Table A7.1. Nominal Pipe Size (NPS). This is a dimensionless designation to define the nomi- nal pipe size (NPS) of the connecting pipe, fitting, or nozzle. Examples include NPS 4 and NPS 6. Flange Pressure Class. This designates the pressure temperature rating of the flange, which is required for all flanges. Examples include Classes 150, 300, 900, and 1500. Standard. Basic flange dimensions for ASME B16.5 are shown in Table A7.2. Examples include ASME B16.5, BS 1560, DIN or API 6A. Material. A material specification for flanges must be specified and be compatible to the piping material specifications. Pipe Schedule. This is only for WN, composite lap-joint and swivel-ring flanges where the flange bore must match that of the pipe, such as schedule 40, 80, 120, and 160. Gaskets A gasket is a material or combination of materials designed to clamp between the mating faces of a flange joint. The primary function of gaskets is to seal the irregulari-

BOLTED JOINTS A.339 ties of each face of the flange, preventing leakage of the service fluid from inside the flange to the outside. The gasket must be capable of maintaining a seal during the operating life of the flange, provide resistance to the fluid being sealed, and meet the temperatures and pressure requirements. Gasket Standards There are a variety of standards that govern dimensions, tolerances, and fabrication of gaskets. The more common international standards are ASME B16.20-1997 Metallic Gaskets for Pipe Flanges, Ring- Joint, Spiral Wound and Jacketed ASME B16.21-1990 Nonmetallic Flat Gaskets for Pipe Flanges BS 4865 Part 1 Flat Ring Gaskets to Suit BS4504 and DIN Flange BS 3381 Spiral Wound Gaskets to Suit BS 1560 Flanges API 6A Specification for Wellhead and Christ- mas Tree Equipment Types of Gaskets Gaskets can be defined into three main categories: nonmetallic, semimetallic, and metallic types. Nonmetallic Gaskets. Usually composite sheet materials are used with flat-face flanges and low pressure class applications. Nonmetallic gaskets are manufactured with nonasbestos material or compressed asbestos fiber (CAF). Nonasbestos types include arimid fiber, glass fiber, elastomer, Teflon (PTFE), and flexible graphite gaskets. Full-face gasket types are suitable for use with flat-face (FF) flanges. Flat- ring gasket types are suitable for use with raised faced (RF) flanges. Gasket dimensions for ASME B16.5 flanges are shown in Table A7.3. Gasket dimensions for ASME B16.47 Series A large diameter steel flanges are shown in Table A7.4a. Gasket dimensions for ASME B16.47 Series B large diameter steel flanges are shown in Table A7.4b. Semimetallic Gaskets. Semimetallic gaskets are composites of metal and nonme- tallic materials. The metal is intended to offer strength and resiliency, while the nonmetallic portion of a gasket provides conformability and sealability. Commonly used semimetallic gaskets are spiral wound, metal jacketed, camprofile, and a variety of metal-reinforced graphite gaskets. Semimetallic gaskets are designed for the widest range of operating conditions of temperature and pressure. Semimetallic gaskets are used on raised face, male-and-female, and tongue-and-groove flanges. Spiral Wound Gaskets. Spiral wound gaskets are the most common gaskets used on raised face flanges. They are used in all pressure classes from Class 150 to Class 2500. The part of the gasket that creates the seal between the flange faces is the spiral wound section. It is manufactured by winding a preformed metal strip and a soft filler material around a metal mandrel. The inside and outside diameters are reinforced by several additional metal windings with no filler.

For applications involving raised face flanges, the spiral wound gasket is supplied with an outer ring; for critical applications it is supplied with both outer and inner rings. The outer ring provides the centering capability of the gasket as well as the blow-out resistance of the windings and acts as a compression stop. The inner ring provides additional load-bearing capability from high-bolt loading. This is particularly advantageous in high-pressure applications. The inner ring also acts as a barrier to the internal fluids and provides resistance against buckling of the windings. Spiral wound–ring gaskets are also used in tongue-and-groove flanges. Inner rings should be used with spiral wound gaskets on male-and-female flanges, such as those found in heat-exchanger, shell, channel, and cover-flange joints. Spiral wound gaskets are designed to suit ASME B16.5 and DIN flanges. See Table A7.5 for dimensions for spiral wound gaskets used with ASME B16.5 flanges. See Table A7.6a and A7.6b for dimensions for spiral wound gaskets used with ASME B16.47 large diameter steel flanges. See Table A7.7 for inner-ring inner diameters for spiral wound gaskets. Camprofile Gaskets. Camprofile gaskets are made from a solid serrated metal core faced on each side with a soft nonmetallic material. The term camprofile (or kammprofile) comes from the groove profile found on each face of the metal core. Two profiles are commonly used: the DIN 2697 profile and the shallow profile. The shallow profile is similar to the DIN 2697 profile except

This allows for a cost advantage for the shallow profile. The profile can be made from sheet metal or strip with a thickness of 3 mm instead of a thickness of 4 mm for DIN profile. For the original German Standard see Fig. A7.4, DIN 2697, Profile for Cam- profile Gasket. The most common facing for camprofile gaskets is flexible graphite. Other facings such as expanded or sintered PTFE and CAF are also used. The camprofile gasket combines the strength, blowout, and creep resistance of a metal core with a soft sealing material that conforms to the flange faces providing a seal. Standard cam- profile gaskets are available to suit ASME B16.5, BS1560, and DIN 2697. These dimensions are shown in Table A7.8, Camprofile Dimensions to Suit Standard Flanges.

Jacketed Gaskets. Jacketed gaskets are made from a nonmetallic gasket mate- rial enveloped in a metallic sheath. This inexpensive gasket arrangement is used occasionally on standard flange assemblies, valves, and pumps. Jacketed gaskets are easily fabricated in a variety of sizes and shapes and are an inexpensive gasket for heat exchangers, shell, channel, and cover flange joints. Their metal seal makes them unforgiving to irregular flange finishes and cyclic operating condi- tions. Jacketed gaskets come in a variety of metal envelope styles. The most common style is double jacketed, shown in Fig. A7.5.

BOLTED JOINTS A.361 Metallic Gaskets. Metallic gaskets are fabricated from one or a combination of metals to the desired shape and size. Common metallic gaskets are ring-joint gaskets and lens rings. They are suitable for high-temperature and pressure ap- plications and require high-bolt loads to seal. Ring-Joint Gaskets. Standard ring- joint gaskets can be categorized into three groups: Style R, RX, and BX. They are manufactured to API 6A and ASME B16.20 standards. Dimensions of Style R gaskets are shown in Table A7.1. Style R gaskets are either oval or oc- tagonal. Style RX is a pressure-ener- gized adaptation of the standard Style R ring-joint gasket. The RX is designed to fit the same groove design as the Stan- dard Style R. These gasket styles are shown in Fig. A7.6. Dimensions of RX gaskets are shown in Table A7.9. Style BX pressure-energized ring joints are designed for use on pressur- ized systems up to 20,000 psi (138 MPa). Flange faces using BX-style gaskets will come in contact with each other when the gasket is correctly fitted and bolted up. The BX gasket incorporates a pres- sure-balance hole to ensure equalization FIGURE A7.5 Double-jacketed gaskets. of pressure which may be trapped in the grooves. Dimensions of BX gaskets are shown in Table A7.10. Lens Rings Gaskets. Lens rings gaskets have a spherical surface and are suited for use with conical flange faces manufactured to DIN 2696. They are used in specialized high-pressure and high-temperature applications. Standard lens rings gaskets in accordance with DIN-2696 are shown in Table A7.11. Other specialty metallic seals are available, including welded-membrane gaskets and weld-ring gaskets. These gaskets come in pairs and are seal-welded to their mating flanges and to each other to provide a zero-leakage high-integrity seal. Bolts and Nuts Bolts and nuts provide for clamping of the flange and gasket components. Bolting is a term that includes studbolts, nuts, and washers. Bolting Standards. The following are international standards that pertain to bolting: ASME B1.1 Unified Inch Screw Threads ASME B18.2.1 Square and Hex Bolts and Screws

The ends of the studbolt are finished with a point having an included angle of approximately 90 degrees to a depth slightly exceeding the depth of the thread. Markings indicating the grade of studbolt are applied to one end of the studbolt. The minimum length of the studbolt should ensure full engagement of the nut such that the point protrudes above the face of the nut. For applications that utilize hydraulic stud-tensioning tools for tightening, one bolt-diameter is added to this minimum length. Hydraulic stud tensioning and other tightening methods are cov- ered later in this chapter. While there is no maximum length of thread, unnecessarily long studs are avoided due to cost and to prevent corrosion and other damage to exposed threads, which would make subsequent removal difficult. Nuts Heavy Series. Heavy-series nuts are generally used with studs on pressure piping. The nonbearing face of a nut has a 30-degree chamfer, while its bearing face is finished with a washer face. Dimensions of heavy-series nuts are shown in Table A7.13.

The primary purpose of a self-locking nut is to resist loosening under service conditions experiencing vibration and shock. The self-locking nut produces an interference fit between the bolt threads and the nut threads. Most common self-locking nuts contain a nylon insert. The degree of interference is controlled during manufacture of the nylon-insert minor diameter. The elastic nature of the nylon provides uniform reaction from nut to nut. Generally, in pressure-piping systems, the primary concern is obtaining and maintaining proper stud preload to affect the gasket seal. Vibration is not normally a concern in these applications, and in situations where vibration is prevalent, adequate preload control will prevent nut rotation and loosening. Washers Flat Washers. Flat washers are used principally to minimize embedment of the nut and to aid torquing. Plain washers are manufactured in accordance with standard ANSI/ASME B18.22.1. Hardened washers are utilized in high-torque applications. Suitable mechanical properties for hardened, stamped, plain washers are covered by ASTM F436. Applicable properties for plain washers rolled from wire shall be AISI 1060 steel or equivalent, heat treated to a hardness of Rockwell C 45–53. Dimensions of preferred sizes of Type A plain washers are shown in Table A7.14. Live Loading. Live loading using belleville springs improves the elasticity of the flange joint. A belleville spring is a washer that is dished in the center to give it a cone shape. The cone shape provides for a very stiff spring, in comparison to coil springs. The cone will deflect and flatten at a specified spring rate (ratio of load to deflection) when subjected to the axial load (Fp) generated in a stud. Figure A7.8 shows a section of a belleville spring. Belleville springs are described by the following dimensions: OD �outside diameter ID �inside diameter t �material thickness h �deflection to flat H �overall height

Flange assemblies always tend to relax in time, particularly at elevated tempera- tures. The rate of relaxation is dependent on many factors, including embedment relaxation of studs and nuts, flange rotation, bolt creep, and gasket creep. The relaxation phenomenon is covered more fully in the section ‘‘Behavior of the Flanged Joint System.’’ The high load-deflection or spring rate, characteristics of belleville springs, aid in maintaining bolt preload, compensating for some of the joint relaxation. The spring rate of a belleville spring depends on geometry, material, and loading conditions.

The hysteresis between increasing and decreasing load (the upper and lower curves, respectively) is caused by the friction between the spring and the loading surfaces. Two springs stacked in parallel doubles the load to flatten the pair with no further increase in deflection. Two springs stacked in series will produce twice the deflection at the same load. FUNCTION OF GASKETS The function of a gasket is to conform to the irregularities of the flange faces to affect a seal, preventing the inside fluid from leaking out. See Fig. A7.10 for a typical flange-gasket arrangement. The leak performance of the gasket is dependent on the stress on the gasket during operation. Each different type of gasket has its own inherent leak-tightness capabilities. The higher the gasket stress, the higher the leak-tightness capability. The ideal gasket is comprised of a body with good load-bearing and recovery characteristics, with a soft conformable surface layer. Gaskets have a combination of elastic and plastic characteristics. Ideal gaskets should have the following properties: 1. Compressibility—Gaskets that have sufficient compressibility to suit the style and surface finish of the flange, ensuring that all the imperfections will be filled with the gasket material. 2. Resilience—Gaskets that have high resilience will enable the gasket to move with the dynamic loadings of the flange to maintain its seating stress. 3. No change in thickness—Gaskets that will not continue to deform under varying load cycles of temperature and pressure or under a constant load at elevated temperatures (creep). Unfortunately, most gaskets available on the market are not ideal gaskets. Most gaskets usually just have one or sometimes two of the above properties. For critical

The most difficult, often critical, property required of a gasket is its ability to resist creep during operation. In high-temperature services, the flanges will heat up at a faster rate than the bolts and under steady-state conditions will continue to be hotter than the bolts as a result of the thermal gradient. This results in a higher thermal expansion of the flanges with respect to the bolts, increasing the boat load and concurrently the gasket stress. The gasket will then deform under the higher applied load during this cycle. Most gaskets will deform permanently and will not rebound when the load cycle goes away with varying conditions. The permanent set or plastic deformation that occurred during operation will cause loss of bolt load and concurrently loss of gasket stress. As gasket stress decreases leak rate increases. FUNCTION OF BOLTS The function of a bolt is to provide a clamp load or preload (Fp) to sufficiently compress and stress the gasket and resist the parting forces exerted by the hydrostatic end force and other external loads. The hydrostatic end force is created by the pressure of the internal fluid across the internal area of flange. The internal area is generally the inside diameter of the sealing element. All bolts behave like a heavy spring. As you turn down the nut against the flange, the bolt stretches and the flange and gasket compress. All bolt-tightening methods result in stretching the bolt. The torque-tightening method uses the thread helix of turning the nut against the reactive forces of the flange to stretch the bolt. The hydraulic bolt-tensioning method utilizes an annular piston threaded on the end of the bolt to provide an axial stretch. Torque tightening and hydraulic bolt

BEHAVIOR OF THE FLANGED JOINT SYSTEM It is important to recognize that the individual components of flanges, gaskets, nuts, and bolts operate together as a system. Gasket companies are continually fielding questions from concerned users about their ‘‘gasket’’ leakage. Gasket leakage is symptomatic of a broader problem. To focus exclusively on the gasket as the cause of the leakage fails to recognize that the flange joint operates as a system, and a systems approach should be used to design flange joints and trouble shoot flange problems. Under actual operating conditions, the confined fluid, under pressure, creates a hydrostatic end force trying to separate the flange faces. The preload developed in the bolts keeps the flanges together while maintaining a residual gasket-seating stress. The internal pressure of the fluid tries to move, go through, or bypass the gasket. This is illustrated in Fig. A7.11, ‘‘What Happens under Actual Operating Conditions.’’ Joint Stiffness The flange joint consists of a series of springs in a combination of tension and compression. The bolts are springs in tension, while the flange is a spring in compres- sion. The interaction of the two depends on their respective stiffness. The interaction between the stiffness of the bolt and flange can be represented by a joint diagram. See Fig. A7.12, ‘‘Joint Diagram of Simple Elastic Joints.’’

BOLTED JOINTS A.375 FIGURE A7.13 Joint diagram with external tensile load (Lx). At the mating surfaces, the bolt sees the preload (Fp) in tension while the joint sees the same preload in compression. Their deflection under this preload is proportional to their respective stiffness. If an external tensile load (Lx) is applied (i.e., pressure end force), the bolt load increases and the bolt lengthens, while the joint unloads. The change in deformation of the bolt equals its change in deformation of the joint such that they maintain contact with each other. The external load is shared between the bolts and the joint in proportion to their stiffness. This is illustrated in Fig. A7.13. In a flange joint containing a gasket, behavior is governed to a great degree by the gasket. Unfortunately, the gasket stiffness is nonlinear and very difficult to predict. Gaskets unload quickly following a steep curve, as shown in Fig. A7.14. FIGURE A7.14 Joint stiffness diagram for a flanged connection with spiral wound gasket.

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.376 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Therefore, externally applied loads have a significant effect on reducing the stress of the gasket. A sufficiently high enough bolt preload is required to compensate for gasket unloading in order to maintain sufficient stresses to seal during operation. If the bolt preload is lost due to bolt creep, gasket creep, or flange rotation, the gasket stress drops dramatically and leakage follows. Elastic Interaction As one bolt is tightened, the flange and gasket partially compress in relation to their relative stiffness. As subsequent bolts are tightened, the joint compresses further. As each additional bolt is tightened, the compression on the joint will tend to reduce the preload in adjacent bolts. Figure A7.15 shows the elastic behavior of a simplified four-bolt flange. After tightening bolts 1 and 2, bolts 3 and 4 are tightened by compressing the joint further and relaxing the previously tightened bolts 1 and 2. The effect of tightening bolts separately and affecting the loads in adjacent bolts is referred to as elastic interaction, or cross talk. Elastic interaction is one reason why wide scatter in bolt preloads are found in flanged joints. Figure A7.16 shows a typical load scatter of a 28-bolt heat-exchanger channel to shell flange. The top line is the preload for each stud as it was originally tightened with torquing. Notice the wide variation in bolt load with this method of tightening. Relaxation of the Flange Joint Flange joint relaxation is one of the most important areas to consider when designing or troubleshooting flange systems. Over and over again, flanges are hydrostatically tested to verify conformance to leak tightness requirements. After successful hydro- static testing, some flanged joints are found to be leaking during startup, shutdown, or at some time during their operating life. Verification of actual bolt load (using ultrasonic measurement) has revealed that the residual load in the studs after the hydrostatic test is usually lower than the original bolt preload achieved during tight- ening. Relaxation of the bolt load observed is due to permanent deformation of the FIGURE A7.15 Elastic behavior of simplified 4-bolt flange.

BOLTED JOINTS A.377 FIGURE A7.16 Typical load scatter of 28-bolt heat exchanger. gasket element experienced as a result of the pressure test loads. During the hydro- static test, high external compressive loads are added to the gasket. The gasket will continue to compress (deform) as a result of the additional hydrostatic end load. Since most gaskets have poor elastic properties, the hydrostatic end force will result in permanent deformation of the gasket. On conclusion of the hydrostatic test, the permanent deformation of the gasket will be seen as loss of bolt load and overall joint relaxation. This is illustrated in Fig. A7.16. The lower curve is the residual bolt load measured after the hydrostatic test. The wide scatter shown is consistent with uncontrolled tightening techniques. The relaxation effects are typical of gaskets that continue to deform under varying load cycles of temperature and pressure or poor creep resistance at elevated temper- atures. This flange would likely leak at any number of points in its operating life. The wide scatter of the bolt loads illustrated in Fig. A7.16 may lead to failure after the hydrostatic test. With the wide load scatter in combination with relaxation of the joint after hydrotest, the joint may leak during startup. In addition, operating temperatures and pressure cycles will continue to relax the joint until there is insufficient bolt load and gasket stress at a particular position around the flange to maintain a seal, and leakage results. Operating relaxation of the flanged joint is affected by the creep-resistant mate- rial properties of the flange, studbolts, and gaskets. Materials that continue to creep (deform) during operation will lead to leakage. The solution to relaxation-affected leak problems is to 1.

Design and install components that are resistant to creep by ensuring that they are suitable for the operating temperatures and pressures. GASKET SELECTION The proper selection of gasket is critical to the success of achieving long-term leak tightness of flanged joints. Due to their widespread usage, gaskets are often taken for granted. Industry demands for reduced flange leakage in environments of increasing process temperatures and pressures have led gasket manufacturers to develop a wide variety of gasket types and materials, with new gaskets being introduced on an ongoing basis. This rapidly changing environment makes, and will continue to make, gasket selection difficult. It is highly recommended that the gasket manufacturer be consulted on the proper selection of gaskets for each application. Gasket manufacturers are familiar with the industry codes and standards and conduct extensive testing of their products to ascertain performance under a variety of operating conditions. Flange design details, service environment, and operating performance guide the gasket selection process. Start with the flange design. Identify the appropriate flange standard, outlining size, type, facing, pressure rating, and materials (i.e., ASME B16.5, NPS 4, Class 1500, RF, carbon steel). Identify the service environment of temperature, pressure, and process fluid. It is useful to highlight gasket-op- erating performance. Gasket-Operating Performance New flange and gasket designs are incorporating tightness factors in their calcula- tions to reduce leak rates. Traditional ASME Section VIII code utilizes m and y gasket factors in the design calculations of flanges. These factors are useful to establish the flange design required to help ensure the overall pressure integrity of the system; however, they are not useful parameters to predict flange leak rates. All flanges leak to a certain degree. Industry requirements are demanding reduc- tion in leak rates along with predictable performance. This has lead to a more rigorous approach to establishing gasket factors and the associated methods for gasketed flanged-joint design. Significant progress has been made in the last six years in Europe by CEN and in North America by ASME’s Pressure Vessel Research Council (PVRC) to establish gasket test procedures and the development of design constants that greatly improve the gasketed flanged-joint design. Maximum allowable leak rates have been estab- lished for various classes of equipment. EPA Fugitive Emissions basic limits are shown below.

BOLTED JOINTS A.379 PVRC has established a new set of gasket factors, Gb, a, and Gs and a related tightness parameter, Tp, which can be used in place of traditional m and y factors in determining required bolt load. Gb and a (Part A testing) represent the initial gasket-compression characteristics. Gb is the gasket stress at a tightness parameter (Tp) of 1; a is the slope of the line of gasket stress versus tightness parameter plotted on a log-log curve. This line shows that the tightness parameter (or leak tightness) increases with increasing gasket stress. That is, the higher the gasket stress, the lower the expected leakage. Gs is the unloading (Part B) gasket stress at a Tp �1. A low value of Gb indicates that the gasket requires low levels of gasket stress for initial seating. Low values of Gs indicate that the gasket requires lower stresses to maintain tightness during operation and can tolerate higher levels of unloading, which maintain sealability. An idealized tightness curve showing the basis for gasket constants Gb, a, and Gs is shown in Fig. A7.17. The data for many gasket styles and materials have been published in various PVRC-sponsored publications. Typical PVRC gasket factors for a variety of gasket types are shown in Table A7.15.

A.384 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS The total bolt load to achieve the same leak tightness of T3 is 1,119,255 lb. These examples would indicate that higher leak tightness can be achieved using the camprofile gasket versus the double-jacketed gasket under the design condi- tions outlined. Types of Gaskets As discussed earlier, gaskets can be defined into three main categories: nonmetallic, semimetallic, and metallic. The general applications for each gasket type are shown in Table A7.16. High Temperature Selection In high temperature applications, above 650�F (343�C), gasket selection becomes even more critical. Many gaskets may perform well at low temperatures but fail to meet leak-tightness requirements at elevated temperatures. Many gaskets lose their resiliency at elevated temperatures, with changes in their elastic behavior. The gasket’s inherent stiffness will also tend to diminish, resulting in the gasket continuing to deform under the applied flange loads. This deformation (or creep) will result in loss of gasket stress, bolt load, and leak tightness. In elevated temperature applications, search out materials that retain their resiliency and gasket designs that will not change in thickness (retain its stiffness). Considerable technical information on gasket selection is available from gasket manufacturers and from other technical sources such as the Pressure Vessel Re- search Council and industry trade associations such as the Fluid Sealing Associa- tion (FSA). BOLT SELECTION Bolts and nuts should be selected to conform to the design specifications set out with the flange design. Care is taken to ensure that the correct grade of material is selected to suit the recommended bolting temperature and stress ranges. Material specifications for bolts are outlined in BS 4882 and ASME Section VIII. Common material specifications for bolts and nuts are shown in Table A7.17. The following information should be specified when ordering bolts and nuts: 1. Quantity 2. Grade of material, identifying symbol of bolt or nut 3. Form ●Bolts or studbolts ●Nuts, regular or heavy series 4. Dimensions ●Nominal diameter, length ●Diameter of plain and reduced portion, length of thread (if applicable) 5.

High Temperature Bolting Applications The relaxation of bolt stress under constant strain conditions is widely recognized and has been measured in research on studbolt assemblies. At temperatures in excess of 300�C, special steels and alloys are required to improve upon the stress relaxation performance of low alloy steels. The relaxation behaviors of different bolting materials are shown in Fig. A7.18. Different nut materials influence the stress-relaxation behavior of the stud, nut assembly. The recommended nut for each grade of stud is shown in Table A7.17. High temperature relaxation is a combined effect of gasket creep, bolt creep, and flange rotation. All three or any combination may occur. The symptoms show up as loose bolts that reduce gasket stress, resulting in increased leakage. FLANGE STRESS ANALYSIS The most common design standard for flanges is in ASME Section VIII, Appendix 3—‘‘Mandatory Rules for Bolted Flange Connections.’’ This standard applies in the design of flanges subject to hydrostatic end loads and to establish gasket seating. The maximum allowable stress values for bolting outlined in the ASME code are design values to be used in determining the minimum amount of bolting required under the code. A distinction is made in the code between the design value and

*Source: piping-handbook*

BOLTED JOINTS A.387 the bolt stress that may actually exist in the field. The ASME code Appendix S further acknowledges that an initial bolt stress higher than design value may (and, in some cases, must) be developed in the tightening operation. This practice to increase bolt stress higher than the design values is permitted by the code, provided that regard is given to ensure against excessive bolt loads, flange distortion, and gross crushing of the gasket. General Requirements Bolt Loads. In the design of the bolted flange connection, the bolt loads are calculated based on two design conditions of operating and gasket seating. Operating Condition. The operating condition determines the minimum load according to where b, G and Pt are defined previously and m is gasket factor expressed as a multiple of internal pressure The equation is the sum of the hydrostatic end force plus a residual gasket load equaling a multiple of internal pressure. Gasket Seating. The second design condition requires a minimum bolt load deter- mined to seat the gasket regardless of internal pressure according to where y is the minimum seating stress for the gasket selected PVRC Method. As discussed earlier the PVRC method can be used as an alternate to Wm1 or Wm2 in calculating the bolt loads used in the design of the flange. Total Required Bolt Areas. These design values on bolt loads are used to establish minimum total cross-sectional areas of the bolts Am. Am is determined as follows: Using PVRC bolt loads: Am is greater of Am1 or Am2 or Amo. Bolts are then selected so that the actual bolt area, Ab, is equal to or greater than Am.

A.388 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Example Calculation. Using the same application outlined in the ‘‘Gasket Selec- tion’’ section, the following shows the calculation of bolt loads using m and y factors. Input Data Operating Conditions Gasket Seating Wm1 �Wm2, therefore Wm1 would govern in the flange design. Note that using the PVRC method, the design bolt load was 645,345 lb, higher than both Wm1 and Wm2. This will be a common occurrence, revealing that higher bolt loads than assumed using m and y factors are required to achieve required leak tightness. Flange Design. The bolt loads used in the flange design by the code is Alternately, where additional safety is desired, the code recommends that the bolt load for flange design is actual bolt area (Ab) times the allowable bolt stress (Sa). For critical flanges, it is suggested that a more conservative approach to flange design be adopted, calculating the design bolt load as actual bolt area (Ab) times expected field bolt stress (Se). The expected field-bolt stress (Se) achieved is often 1.5 �Sa. By using this approach a higher bolt load is determined. This will increase the flange thickness. The benefits to increased flange thickness are 1. Thicker flanges will rotate less and distribute the applied bolt load more uniformly to the gasket. 2. Thicker flanges require longer bolts. Longer bolts have more strain energy and are more forgiving to joint relaxation. Finite Element Analysis Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is being used more frequently to review designs of critical flanges. FEA costs are dropping dramatically while the procedure’s effective- ness to model complex structure is increasing.

BOLTED JOINTS A.389 FEA can be used to predict the behavior of the flange structure subjected to its operating conditions. It is possible to predict the behavior of the flange structure mathematically because the behavior of the materials can be described mathemati- cally. Hooke’s law describes the mechanical behavior of the metal materials and their elastic response. Other types of stress-strain relationships have been developed to model the nonlinear, plastic behavior of the gasket. The key is to determine the actual operating stress on the gasket to predict its leak-tightness performance subjected to thermal effects, pressure, bolt stress, relaxation, and flange rotation. ASSEMBLY CONDITIONS The flange components consisting of flange, gaskets, and bolts may have been adequately designed but their performance to specifications will be affected by assembly conditions. Flange Surface Finish Flange surface finish is critical to achieve the design-sealing potential of the gasket. Again, gasket-leak tightness is dependent upon its operating gasket stress. Flanges that are warped, pitted, rotated, and have incorrect flange gasket-surface finish will impair the leak tightness of the gasket. Flanges out of parallelism and flatness should be held within ASME B 16.5 specifications. This will ensure that the uniform bolt loads translate to uniform gasket stress. The resiliency and compressibility of the gasket are affected by flange surface finish. Recommended flange surface finishes for various gasket types are shown in Table A7.18.

A.390 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Gasket Condition Never reuse a gasket. A gasket’s compressibility and resiliency are severely reduced once it has been used. Check the gasket for any surface defects along the contact faces that may im- pair sealing. Keep the gasket on its storage board until immediately prior to assembly. Do not use any gasket compounds to install the gasket to the flange, as it affects the compressibility, resiliency, and creep behavior of the gasket. Consult the gasket manufacturer when installing large diameter gaskets for a recommendation on how to secure them to the flange during installation. Bolt Condition Bolts and nuts may be reused providing they are in new condition. Ensure bolts and nuts are clean, free of rust, and that the nut runs freely on the bolt threads. Install bolts and nuts well lubricated by using a high quality anti-seize lubricant to the stud threads and the nut face. Methods of Bolt Tightening Once the total bolt loads (W) are calculated for the flanges, specifications, and procedures should be adopted outlining how to achieve the design bolt load. The total bolt load (W) for the flange is divided by the number of bolts to determine the individual bolt preload (Fp). To achieve improved leak tightness sufficient and uniform gasket stress must be realized in the field. This obviously requires uniform and correct applied bolt load. The higher the requirement to reduce leakage, the more controlled the method bolt tightening. The common methods of bolt tightening are: ●hammer, impact wrenches ●torque wrenches ●hydraulic tensioning systems Each method has its own assembly efficiency. Bolt tightening methods and their assembly efficiencies are shown in Table A7.19. Hammer, Impact Wrenches Method This method remains the most common form of bolt tightening. The advantages are speed and ease of use. Disadvantages include a lack of preload control and the inability to generate sufficient preload on large bolts. Torque Method Torque wrenches are often regarded as a means to improve control over bolt preload in comparison with hammer-tightening methods. However, as indicated in Table A7.19, significant variation in stud-to-stud load control is still evident.

However, it is not the torque that is important but the end result of the torque-bolt preload. Control over bolt preload is the factor for ensuring proper gasket-seating stresses are achieved. Torque is the measure of the torsion required to turn a nut up the inclined plane of a thread. The efficiency of the nut’s turn along the bolt thread to generate preload is dependent upon many factors, including thread pitch, friction between the threads, and friction between the nut face and the flange face. In general, only about 10 percent of the applied torque goes toward providing bolt preload. The rest is lost in overcoming friction: 50 percent in overcoming the friction between the nut and flange faces, and 40 percent in overcoming friction between the threads of the nut and the bolt. Another variable to overcome is the elastic behavior of the joint as illustrated in Fig. A7.15. As the bolts are tightened creating the desired preload, the flange will partially compress. As additional bolts are tightened, the flange joint will compress a little further. The continuous deflection of the flanged joint reduces the stretch (or preload) of previously tightened joints. This phenomenon is referred to as cross talk and is a result of tightening a multistud flange one bolt at a time. A typical wide variation in bolt and bolt preload is experienced using torquing because of the uncontrolled effects of friction and cross talk, as illustrated in Fig. A7.16, ‘‘Typical Load Scatter of 28 Bolt Heat Exchanger Flange.’’ Torque Calculations. The amount of torque that is required to generate a specific bolt preload is calculated by where K �nut factor, experimentally determined (see Table A7.20) D �nominal diameter of stud, in Fp �desired bolt preload, calculated by dividing total design bolt load (W) by number of bolts

Randomly select a bolt and designate it as bolt number 1. Proceed in a clockwise motion to the next bolt and add four to the previous bolt number. Moving clockwise, the next bolt number would be 1, 5, 9, and so on. This system of adding four to the previous bolt number continues until adding four to the previous number exceeds the total number of bolts in a flange. At this

BOLTED JOINTS A.393 point, start again at bolt number 3. Continue in the same clockwise direction, numbering bolts 3, 5, 11, and so on until again this number is larger than the total number of bolts in a flange. At this point the next number is 2; continue as previously described: 2, 6, 10, and so on. The last series of bolt numbers start with bolt number 4 and continue 8, 12, 16, and so on. A sample 16-bolt flange showing a typical cross pattern is shown in Fig. A7.19. FIGURE A7.19 Typical torquing cross pattern of a 16-bolt flange. Tensioning Systems Many of the variables that reduce the control of bolt preload using the torque process are eliminated using hydraulic tensioning systems. Hydraulic tensioners are hollow hydraulic compact cylinders that are threaded onto a protruding section of the studbolt generally using a pulling device. A bridge supports the hydraulic head straddling the nut and reacting against the flange while hydraulic pressure is applied to the hydraulic head. Under the applied hydraulic load, the bolt stretches at the same time as it compresses the flange and gasket. Residual bolt load equivalent to the desired preload (Fp) is achieved by manually turning down the nut under the tensioner bridge during the applied hydraulic load. Applied bolt load is directly proportional to the hydraulic pressure and the area of the hydraulic cylinder. There are no frictional losses associated with tensioning, as compared to torquing. A cross section of a hydraulic stud tensioner is illustrated in Fig. A7.20. The residual load (preload Fp) �Applied Load �Load Loss Factor. The load loss factor is dependent upon the stud stress realized, bolt diameter, and effective length of the bolt. For each application its load loss factor can be precisely calculated to determine the necessary applied load to generate the residual preload. Development of thorough procedures is essential to maintain the accuracy of hydraulic stud-tensioning process. Cross talk is significantly reduced by utilizing multistud tensioning. Generally 50 percent of the studs in a flange are tensioned simultaneously by using multiple

Many flange configurations allow for 100 percent of the studs to be tensioned simultaneously. This completely eliminates cross talk. Hydraulic tensioning provides the most controlled tightening method for achiev- ing specified bolt preload. Controlled Bolting Controlled bolting is the method where the loading-stress of the flange bolts is measured using ultrasonic equipment to ensure that the correctly specified bolt preload is achieved. The application of torque alone to the flange is not controlled bolting, as there remain many uncertainties about the actual bolt load. Torquing in combination with ultrasonic measure provides necessary controls to achieve the required bolt preload. Multistud tensioning following established procedures provides a high degree of control over bolt preload. In critical application, multistud tensioning should also be combined with ultrasonic measurement to verify that all specifications are met.

BOLTED JOINTS A.395 BOLT LOAD MONITORING Monitoring of the actual residual bolt load after tightening is essential to ensure that leak-tightness goals are achieved and becomes an important part of the quality assurance process of achieving flange joint integrity. All tightening methods provide a degree of stud-preload scatter as a function of their process capability. The only way to be sure that specified stud preload is achieved is to measure it. There are several methods for performing stud-stretch measuring, including strain gauges, bow micrometers, mechanical extensometers, and ultrasonic exten- someters. The most common and versatile is the ultrasonic extensometer. Theory of Operation The ultrasonic extensometer operates by placing a high-frequency transducer at one end of the stud. Frequencies used for stud measurement range from 1 to 20 megahertz. At these frequencies a liquid couplant (gel) is used to couple the ultra- sound from the transducer to the stud. An ultrasound wave is generated by the transducer and travels down the body length of the stud. The wave reflects off the opposite end of the stud and travels back to the transducer. The ultrasonic instrument measures the time of flight of the ultrasound in the stud. Many factors, including material density, stud length, temperatures, and stress are used to convert the time-of-flight measurement into an ultrasonic reference length. Hooke’s Law and Stud-Stretch Measurement All studs elongate in their elastic region following Hooke’s law, as outlined in the section ‘‘Function of Bolts’’. In the relaxed state, a reference length is measured using the ultrasonic extenso- meter. After the stud has been tightened, an additional reading is made to measure stud stretch. Given the known parameters of effective bolt length (Lb), tensile area of bolt (As), Young’s modulus of elasticity (E), the preload (Fp) can now be directly correlated to stretch. Rearranging equation A7.1 allows the calculation of bolt preload (Fp): The measured residual preload can then be compared to design preload to ensure it falls within an acceptable tolerance. Alternately the stretch reading �Lb actual is compared to �Lb design. Example A7.2 Example Calculation: Application: Heat exchange–Reboiler channel

MANAGING FLANGE JOINT INTEGRITY Leaks are a threat to profits, safety, and the environment. Problems resulting from leaks in flanges can range from local in severity to plant-wide catastrophe. Although the range of negative results can vary widely, leaks have one thing in common: all leaks are preventable. Leaks don’t happen by accident, they happen by design. Rather than being symptoms of product failure, leaks are generally evidence of failure in process control. When you fix the process control, you fix the leaks before they happen. This chapter has reviewed the key elements to achieving flange joint integrity to assure leak-free integrity of the bolted flange joint. An integrated approach must be adopted to ensure success of the process of joint integrity. This process begins with an understanding of the operating environment, contin- ues with design and selection of the flange components, setting of assembly specifi- cations, establishment of best-practices procedures, assignment of competent per- sonnel, quality assurance, traceability through complete documentation, and finishes with meeting the goal of leak prevention. The goal of leak prevention is achievable and starts with a mind-set of doing things right the first time.

CHAPTER A8 PRESTRESSED CONCRETE CYLINDER PIPE (PCCP) AND FITTINGS Richard E. Deremiah, P.E. Project Manager Price Brothers Company Dayton, Ohio INTRODUCTION History Prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP) has been manufactured in the United States since 1942. An American Water Works Association (AWWA) tentative standard was developed in 1949 and was made a permanent standard in 1952. Since that time, this standard has been reviewed and updated on a regular basis. PCCP offers the specifier and owner numerous advantages, including ease of installation, custom-designed fittings, superior corrosion resistance, high-flow characteristics, low maintenance costs, and product support by the manufacturer. PCCP is used extensively for a wide range of project types both in the United States and around the world. There are three other types of concrete pressure pipe: reinforced concrete cylin- der pipe (referenced in the AWWA Standard C3001), reinforced concrete noncylin- der pipe (referenced in the AWWA Standard C3022), and pretensioned concrete cylinder pipe (referenced in the AWWA Standard C3033). Terminology and Definitions Spigot ring— the protruding end of a PCCP joint which contains a shaped groove to re- tain the O-ring rubber gasket (refer to Fig. A8.1) A.397

Uses include raw and potable water transmission lines, water distribution systems, gravity and pressure sewers, power plant cooling systems, industrial process lines, water and wastewater treatment plant process lines, sewer outfalls, raw water intakes, and impoundment- dam spillway conduits. It is a versatile pipe that can be installed in the normal direct-buried condition; as an aerial crossing over canals, rivers, and other obstacles; or subaqueously in both freshwater and seawater. Reference Standards Table A8.1 summarizes the standards covering the design and manufacture of PCCP.

DESCRIPTION Pipe Types Prestressed concrete cylinder pipe consists of a structural, high-strength concrete core, a steel cylinder with steel joint rings welded at each end providing water- tightness, steel prestressing wire, and a portland cement-rich mortar coating. Two FIGURE A8.3 (a) Lined cylinder pipe (LCP) and (b) embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) profiles.

PRESTRESSED CONCRETE CYLINDER PIPE (PCCP) AND FITTINGS A.401 FIGURE A8.4 Typical elbow fitting. types of PCCP are manufactured: lined cylinder pipe (LCP), which is detailed in Fig. A8.3a and embedded cylinder pipe (ECP), which is detailed in Fig. A8.3b. Lined cylinder pipe has the entire concrete core placed inside the steel cylinder. The cured concrete core and steel cylinder are then helically wrapped with pre- stressing wire, which is subsequently coated with cement mortar. Embedded cylinder pipe has the concrete core placed both outside and inside the steel cylinder by a vertical casting operation. The cured concrete core and steel cylinder are then helically wrapped with prestressing wire and, as LCP, is coated with cement mortar. Available Size Ranges LCP is normally manufactured with inside diameters ranging from NPS 16 (DN 400) through NPS 48 (DN 1200), although larger sizes have been made. ECP is normally manufactured with inside diameters ranging from NPS 54 (DN 1350) through NPS 144 (DN 3600), but diameters smaller and larger than this range are possible. The nominal laying length for pipe up to and including NPS 114 (DN 2850) is usually 20 ft (6 m), and 16 ft (4.9 m) for larger sizes. These diameter ranges and laying lengths can sometimes vary by manufacturer, so the user should check with suppliers on specific sizes. In larger sizes, the laying length can be controlled

Fittings and Special Pipe A wide range of fittings and special pipe lengths are available for all types of project requirements. Fittings are manufactured from steel plate which is cut, rolled, and welded to form the required shape. The completed steel shell is lined and coated with portland cement mortar for corrosion protection. Each fitting is designed for the same external load and internal pressure as the adjoining pipe. Common fittings are elbows, tees, wyes, reducers, wall pieces, and adapters. Adapters are needed for connections to other types of joints such as flanges, mechanical joints, and couplings. Figures A8.4 through A8.7 show the general configurations of elbows, tees, concentric reducers, and flange adapters. Special pipe consists of prestressed pipe lengths with additional features such as outlets or beveled ends. Prestressed pieces with a laying length shorter than the standard constitute a special pipe that can be supplied to match specific job require- ments.

A.404 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS DESIGN Design Parameters PCCP is designed as a rigid structure to resist the simultaneous application of external loads and internal pressures. External dead loads normally encountered are earth loads, foundation loads, or surcharges applied at the ground surface. External live loads are caused by vehicular traffic, railroads, or construction equip- ment. The weight of the pipe and the weight of water inside the pipe are also considered in the design procedure. Internal pressures used for design are the working pressure, transient pressure, and the field hydrostatic test pressure. The working pressure should be the expected steady-state internal pressure for the system. The transient pressure is the expected internal pressure over and above the working pressure that can occur during surge (water hammer) conditions. If the purchaser does not include a transient pressure in the specifications, the AWWA C3045 design standard requires that, as a minimum, the transient pressure allowance be 40 percent of the working pressure, or 40 psi (0.27 MPa), whichever is greater. A postconstruction hydrostatic pressure test is usually conducted to confirm the structural integrity and watertightness of the completed system. In the absence of a field hydrostatic test pressure specified by the purchaser, the AWWA C304 design standard requires the use of a test pressure of 1.2 times the working pressure. Support under the pipe provided by the bedding material must also be used in the design procedure. Various suggested bedding types are shown in the AWWA C304 design standard. The pipe purchaser’s plans and specifications should contain as a minimum the following design parameters for PCCP: Earth cover over the top of the pipe Expected live load (normally AASHTO HS20 truck loading configuration) Internal working pressure Internal transient pressure allowance Field hydrostatic test pressure Bedding type The pipe and fittings manufacturer will design and manufacture the pipe and fittings to comply with the pressures and loadings specified. Hydraulics Energy use in pipeline operation can be greatly reduced during the design stage. Head losses due to pipe wall friction are among the most manageable causes of energy consumption for pipelines which use pumps. These losses can be minimized with the use of pipe which has excellent long-term hydraulic characteristics and by selecting a large enough pipe diameter to avoid high-flow velocities which accelerate energy costs. Energy savings resulting from these design decisions will help reduce operating costs each year throughout the life of the pipeline.

PRESTRESSED CONCRETE CYLINDER PIPE (PCCP) AND FITTINGS A.405 Flow Formulas Over the years, many empirical flow formulas have been proposed. The Hazen- Williams formula, shown below, was first published by Allen Hazen and Gardner S. Williams in 1905, and continues to be the most widely used for pressure pipe systems. where V �mean velocity, ft/s where V �mean velocity, m/s Ch �Hazen-Williams flow Ch �Hazen-Williams flow coefficient coefficient d �inside pipe diameter, ft d �inside pipe diameter, m hL �head loss, ft hL �head loss, m L �pipe length, ft L �pipe length, m A statistical analysis of 67 flow tests of concrete pressure lines was made by Swanson and Reed and published in the January 1963 AWWA Journal.7 Some of this pipe was manufactured as early as 1895. This report presented a ‘‘best fit’’ mean deviation comparison with the well-known formulas by Hazen-Williams, Morris, Moody, and Scobey. The authors concluded that the Hazen-Williams expression for head loss most closely matched the test results for the range of velocities normally encountered in water transmission. The average mean deviation between calculated and observed losses was lowest for the Hazen-Williams formula. A regression analysis least-squares method was used to develop a correlation equation for the Hazen-Williams ‘‘Ch’’ term for concrete pipe, as follows: where d �inside pipe diameter, ft where d �inside pipe diameter, m The Hazen-Williams flow formula can be rewritten in a more convenient form where head loss is expressed in terms of flow velocity. Head loss in ft: Head loss in m: Head Losses Due to Fittings While head losses due to fittings are generally a minor portion of the overall head loss in a pipeline, they can be important in certain applications such as treatment plants when the length of a line is short and the number of fittings is high. These head losses occur in elbows, reducers, enlargements, valves, and other fittings in the pipeline. The rational method of calculating these losses assumes full turbulence and expresses the loss in terms of velocity head. This expression is

Figure A8.9 shows the various steps in the manufacturing process for fittings. The AWWA standard C3014 provides a comprehensive description of the manufactur- ing requirements for pipe and fittings. The purchaser should require, in the specifi- cations, that all pipe and fittings be manufactured per the AWWA C301 standard. Quality Assurance All PCCP manufacturers should establish quality assurance departments within the pipe plant to provide step-by-step attention to all production procedures and assure that all machinery and equipment is operating properly. Incoming raw materials must be carefully inspected and tested for compliance with the governing standards. The AWWA C301 standard contains the testing methods to be used and acceptance criteria for all raw materials to be incorporated into the pipe and fittings. FIGURE A8.8 PCCP manufacturing process.

Restrained Joints Figure A8.10 depicts a Snap Ring�type restrained joint and Fig. A8.11 a harness clamp type restrained joint. These joints can be used to resist axial tensile forces on the pipe due to unbalanced thrusts caused by internal pressure at fittings such as elbows, tees, and bulkheads. The Snap Ring joint incorporates a split ring which is preassembled in the manufacturing plant so that it is recessed into a groove in the bell ring. After the spigot is pushed home into the bell, the installer tightens a single bolt which draws the split ring down around the shank of the spigot ring. This effectively locks the joint together. The harness clamp joint utilizes a two-part clamp which engages bars on the bell and spigot rings. After the spigot is pushed home into the bell, the installer places the clamp halves over the harness bars, securing them with bolts and nuts. The clamp installed in this manner locks the joint together. FIGURE A8.11a Lined cylinder pipe harness clamp restrained joint. FIGURE A8.11b Embedded cylinder pipe harness clamp restrained joint.

This feature is sometimes necessary for certain pipelines in power, industrial, water, and wastewater plants; for pipe in tunnel casings; and for subaque- ous pipelines.

Testable joints should not be considered a replacement for postconstruction hydrostatic pressure tests since they do not confirm the overall system integrity (restrained joints or concrete thrust blocks) and watertightness of connecting appurtenances such as valves and access manholes. Other types of special joints available for PCCP include subaqueous joints and bonded joints. Subaqueous joints, depicted in Figs. A8.13a and A8.13b, are designed to facilitate jointing underwater by divers. They normally incorporate external lug and drawbolt assemblies. Bonded joints, shown in Figs. A8.14a, A8.14b, and A8.14c, are designed to provide electrical continuity across the joint for the future monitor- ing of electrical activity on the pipeline or for the application of cathodic protection. INSTALLATION Pipe Handling and Storage A crane or backhoe outfitted with a steel cable sling may be used to unload pipe unless the pipe has a special exterior coating that could be damaged by a steel cable sling. In such cases, a fabric sling should be used. Multiple slings are often used in handling large pipe and fittings. Pipe can be stored directly on the ground in nonfreezing conditions. If freezing conditions are expected, the pipe should be set on wooden timbers off the ground to prevent the pipe from becoming frozen to the ground. Rubber gaskets should be stored in a cool place, out of the sun, away from fuel oil, gasoline, electric motors, and any other environment that can damage rubber. Excavation and Bedding Preparation In most cases, the trench is excavated to be long enough for one section of pipe. The trench should be wide enough to allow installing personnel adequate room to work at the sides of the pipe. Pipe should not be laid directly on rocks or other unyielding foundation. Refer to the AWWA C304 standard for the bedding and backfill requirements for PCCP. Jointing Just prior to jointing, the steel joint rings should be carefully cleaned and the rubber gasket and contact surfaces of the joint rings lubricated. Only lubricant recommended by the pipe manufacturer should be used. Once the joint ends are properly prepared and the rubber gasket is in place on the spigot, the ends are aligned so the spigot will enter the bell squarely. Then the spigot is pushed home with a smooth, continuous motion. The position of the gasket is then checked in the manner recommended by the pipe manufacturer. A fabric band is secured around the exterior joint recess to receive the portland cement grout for corro- sion protection.

A.412 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Backfilling After the joint has been assembled and the exterior joint recess has been grouted, the pipe can be backfilled to grade. In general, the requirements for backfilling rigid PCCP will not be as critical as for flexible types of pipe such as steel, plastic, and ductile iron. The backfill in contact with the pipe should not contain large rocks, clods, or excessive organic material. Field Hydrostatic Testing In most situations, a post-construction hydrostatic pressure test of the completed pipeline is required before final acceptance by the owner. For very long lines, it may be convenient to test shorter sections as they are completed rather than wait and test the entire project at one time. This test can verify the overall system integrity such as the restrained joints or thrust blocks and the watertightness of the connecting appurtenances such as valves, access manholes, and outlets. Repair Occasionally, damage may occur in the field due to impacts from construction equipment or other objects. Minor damage can usually be repaired in the field by qualified personnel. Major damage may require shipment of the piece back to the manufacturing plant for repair or replacement. Before attempting any repairs in the field, the pipe manufacturer should be consulted for specific recommendations and assistance. Special Installation Situations During the design phase of some projects, areas of unstable soil conditions and crossings of small rivers, streams, or canals should be identified. In these cases, a pier support arrangement for the pipe may be needed. The pipe for this application must be designed and manufactured to span the supports and to resist the concen- trated load applied to the pipe at the support. PCCP to be placed underwater such as for intakes, outfalls, or lake and river crossings may require special consideration for joining pipe underwater by divers. PCCP to be used for subaqueous lines may have modifications made to the joints to allow for joint engaging assemblies such as drawbolts, or special devices may be used which create a vacuum force to pull the joint home while the pipe’s weight is supported by a barge-mounted crane. In either case, it may be advantageous to use longer pipe lengths in order to minimize the number of underwater joint assemblies. The concrete and mortar linings and coatings specified in the AWWA C301 standard provide ample corrosion protection in most buried environments. There are, however, certain conditions where the ability of the concrete and mortar to provide a passivating environment around the embedded steel may need to be supplemented. Additional protective measures may be needed in these instances. These conditions include ●High chloride environment ●Stray current interference

PRESTRESSED CONCRETE CYLINDER PIPE (PCCP) AND FITTINGS A.413 ●High sulfate environments ●Severe acid conditions ●Aggressive carbon dioxide ●Atmospheric exposure ●Connections to other pipelines Refer to the AWWA manual ‘‘M9—Concrete Pressure Pipe’’6 for further infor- mation on the identification and evaluation of these conditions. The pipe manufac- turer should also be consulted for specific recommendations and availability of supplemental protective measures. Tapping Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe Outlets, tees, and wyes can be built into the pipe when their need is identified at the time the project is designed. When unforeseen circumstances occur that require outlets, connections, or branch lines on already installed pipe, tapping of PCCP can be done. Tapping PCCP for connecting outlets after a pipeline is installed is a common occurrence on most public works projects. Taps can easily be made on PCCP.

Tap diameters commonly range from NPS ³⁄₄ (DN 20) up to one size smaller than the pipe being tapped. For full size branch connections, a cut-in tee arrangement or a line stopping process may be feasible. The tapping saddle assembly used must be properly designed to work with PCCP. Figure A8.15 shows a strap- type tapping saddle assembly, and Fig. A8.16 shows a larger flange-type tapping saddle assembly. The strap-type saddle is normally used for tap diameters NPS ³⁄₄ (DN 20) to NPS 2 (DN 50). The flange-type saddle is used for tap diameters NPS 3 (DN 80) and larger.

CHAPTER A9 GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS Louis E. Hayden, Jr. Divisional Operations Manager Victaulic Company of America Easton, Pennsylvania The use of mechanical joints in the design and construction of piping systems is rapidly becoming a general practice. This chapter discusses two types of mechanical pipe joints. The first is a mechanically pressed joint called Pressfit�* that is designed to join light-wall carbon steel and stainless steel pipe. The second joint is generically termed a grooved joint. This type of joint is designed for joining any type of pipe, metallic or nonmetallic, that is capable of being cut or roll grooved. Both types of joints rely on a mechanical interlock with the pipe end for pressure and structural integrity and an elastomeric gasket for the pressure boundary seal. PRESSFIT� Introduction The Pressfit piping system is an innovative, rigid, self-restrained mechanical joining method for schedule 5 or lighter weight lightweight stainless steel and carbon steel pipe. This proprietary mechanical pipe joint is designed for use in small-bore piping systems, NPS ¹⁄₂ (DN15) to NPS 2 (DN50). The Pressfit system may be applied to any service that is compatible with the piping materials, the gasket material, and the temperature range of the system, unless prohibited by the manufacturer’s in- structions. Typical applications would include building-services piping, potable wa- ter, fire protection, heating and cooling, industrial processes, process cooling and heating systems, plant utilities, and vacuum systems. Joint Concept The Pressfit joining system concept is illustrated in Fig. A9.1 The left side of Fig. A9.1 shows the pipe fully inserted into the Pressfit fitting in the ‘‘unpressed’’ condi- * Pressfit�is a registered trademark of Victaulic Company of America.

Note that the pressing operation indents the Pressfit fitting and pipe, thus providing the mechanical restraint required to resist pressure and external loads that try to separate the pipe. The O-ring seal has also been compressed to provide the pressure-boundary seal of the joint. Additionally, the final pressed shape of the Pressfit joint provides resistance to torsional movement. Industry Specification, Codes and Product Testing Pressfit fittings and pipe meet the requirements of the following specifications, codes, and standards: ●Pressfit carbon steel products meet the requirements of ASTM A53 Grade A and A135 Grade A. Pressfit stainless steel products meet the requirements of ASTM A312 Grade 316/316L and ASTM A269 Grade 304/304L. ●Pressfit products meet the requirements for use in piping systems designed to comply with ASME B31.1, B31.3 and B31.9 piping codes.

Pressfit joints are made using generally accepted pipe fitting techniques with the addition of the following requirements: ●Each pipe end must be marked by measuring back from the end to establish an insertion or witness mark. This mark should be highly visible and extend for at least 180�of the pipe circumference. The insertion depth should be measured and marked as shown in Table A9.2. ●The marked pipe end should be fully inserted into the Pressfit fitting completely to the pipe stop.

The Pressfit pipe fitting should be squared to the pipe and pressed onto the pipe using the proper pressing jaw and Pressfit tool. System Installation As with all piping systems, a Pressfit system must be properly installed to provide the system performance envisioned by the piping designer. At minimum, the following installation requirements should be considered: ●System Support: Like all other piping systems, pipe joined with Pressfit joints requires support to carry the weight of the piping system, system fluid, and other system equipment. As in other methods of joining pipes, the support or hanging method must be adequate to eliminate undue stresses on joints, piping, and other TABLE A9.2 Pressfit insertion mark depth—In (mm) Size NPS ¹⁄₂ NPS ³⁄₄ NPS 1 NPS 1¹⁄₄ NPS 1¹⁄₂ NPS 2 DN 15 DN 20 DN 25 DN 32 DN 40 DN 50 Depth ⁷⁄₈ 1 1 1¹⁄₄ 1¹⁄₂ 1⁷⁄₈ (22) (25) (25) (32) (40) (48)

The suggested maximum span between supports for Pressfit piping systems is shown in Table A9.3. ●Thermal Expansion and Contraction: As with all rigid piping systems, piping installed utilizing Pressfit joints must be reviewed by the piping designer to assure proper allowances are incorporated into the piping system design to elimi- nate undue stresses from thermal expansion or contraction. The use of flexible mechanical coupling-type expansion joints is highly recom- mended for this service. If installation of flexible mechanical joints is not pos- sible or desired, the designer is encour- aged to use single-leg (Z-shaped) or dual-leg (U-shaped) expansion com- pensation loops as shown in Figs. A9.5 and A9.6 For calculated piping move- ment, �l, the minimum expansion FIGURE A9.5 Z-shaped expansion compen- compensate leg length L may be deter- sator. mined by using Figs. A9.7 and A9.8 As a result of thermal expansion and contraction of pipe, Pressfit joints may be subjected to torsional or rotational movement. Rotational angles must be limited to a maximum of 5�. Advantages of Pressfit The Pressfit pipe joint was conceived to provide a fast, clean, and cool method of installing lightweight carbon and stainless steel piping systems. Advantages provided by using Pressfit are listed as follows:

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.423 FIGURE A9.6 U-shaped expansion compensator pipe with fittings. ●The Pressfit piping system, with its lower weight, lack of required pipe-end prepa- ration, along with ease and speed of pressing joints, will provide a lower final cost installation to the contractor and owner than the same size carbon or stainless steel system installed by threading, flanging, or welding. ●Due to the design of the Pressfit fitting, piping designers can take advantage of the full-rated pressure capability of the Pressfit fitting across the allowed temperature range of the selected O-ring material. Pressure derating with an increase in metal temperature is not a factor in Pressfit systems as compared to a flanged system. Refer to Figs. A9.2, A9.3, and A9.4 for comparison. ●Pipe used in piping systems utilizing Pressfit joints has thinner nominal wall thickness than Schedule 40 pipe used in most applications where Pressfit should FIGURE A9.7

A.424 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A9.8 be considered. This difference results in significant increases of flow area and less pressure drop in Pressfit piping systems, compared to systems designed utilizing Schedule 40 pipe. A tabulation of these factors is shown in Tables A9.4 and A9.5. ●When considering carbon steel Pressfit and Schedule 40 piping from an internal corrosion perspective, the Pressfit system provides adequate performance when used in closed-loop service where water treatment is maintained or introduction of oxygen into the system is limited to periodic testing or system makeup. In Table A9.6 and Fig. A9.9, the corrosion resistance ratio (CRR) of Schedule 5 and Schedule 40 carbon-steel Pressfit pipe are compared. The corrosion resistance ratio (CRR) is a method, established by Underwriters’ Laboratories in 1970, by which to compare the effective wall thicknesses for various pipes.

A.426 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A9.9 GROOVED MECHANICAL PIPE JOINTS Introduction The grooved piping method for mechanically joining pipe is recognized as the fast, easy, economical, and reliable method of joining pipe for many services. With over 70 years of service experience, the grooved piping method is now accepted along with the pipe joining methods, such as welding, flanging, and threading. The grooved system provides a self-restrained pipe connection which can with- stand the full-pressure thrust loads at the maximum-rated working pressure of the coupling. Easy assembly also allows easy disassembly. This, in combination with a union at every joint, permits easy system access for maintenance, repair, component replacement, and retrofits. Also, fittings can be loosely assembled and rotated to line up with mating components before the couplings are tightened. This eases work in tight places and around existing pipe, structures, or equipment. Features such as easy assembly, system access, and installation in confined spaces are not available with other joining methods. Reference Codes, Standards, and Specifications Grooved joints consist of grooved pipe ends and grooved pipe couplings. The pipes themselves may meet many various industry specifications. The pipe ends and couplings meet the requirements of the following: Pipe Grooves—ANSI/AWWA C606–87 Grooved and Shouldered Joints Pipe Couplings—ASTM F1476–93 Standard Specification for Performance of Gasketed Mechanical Couplings for use in Piping Applications Grooved couplings may meet the requirements or be listed by the following codes or agencies.

Listed (ANSI/NSF-61) Joint Concept The grooved pipe-joining method is simple and reliable. The coupling housing performs several functions as an integral part of the pipe joint. It contains the fully enclosed gasket and reinforces and secures it in position for a proper seal. The housing also engages the pipe grooves around the full pipe circumference and creates a unified joint while it provides the advantages of mechanical joining. The leak-tight joint is created without exposing workers and property to the fire, smoke, and health hazards associated with welded joints or with welding flanges onto pipe. Types of Grooves Cut Groove. Grooved piping systems normally use two types of grooves. The first type, cut groove, is achieved by machining a groove in the pipe end. This type of groove may be used for standard weight and heavier pipe walls, cast ductile iron pipe, and other pipe materials that do not lend themselves to mechanical deforma- tion, such as fiberglass reinforced plastic. Cut grooving removes material from the pipe wall and therefore should not be used for grooves in pipes with walls thinner than standard weight. Rolled Groove. The second type, roll groove, is achieved by placing the pipe end in a roll grooving machine and rolling (mechanically deforming) a groove into the pipe. This grooving is accomplished by pressing a grooving roll into the pipe wall as the pipe is rotated by the machine. The resultant groove does not remove any pipe material. Fig. A9.10 shows the roll grooving process.

A.428 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A9.10 Roll grooving process. Types of Couplings Flexible Couplings. As with grooves, there are two basic types of pipe couplings. The first type is defined as a flexible coupling. Flexible couplings allow for controlled pipe movement within the coupling while maintaining a positive seal and a self- restrained joint. Such performance is achieved through the combination of the elastomeric gasket, which seals the joint, with the housing, which engages the groove without clamping rigidly onto the pipe. The design allows for expansion, contraction, and deflection generated by thermal changes, building or ground settlement, and seismic activity. Pipe movement accommodation with flexible couplings will mini- mize the stresses that can be generated by this movement. Figure A9.11 is an exaggerated illustration of a flexible coupling. A welded system requires additional components such as expansion loops and expansion joints, since it consists solely

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.429 FIGURE A9.11 Flexible coupling. of rigid connections and has no inherent characteristics to prevent the buildup of thermal and mechanical stresses. In order to ensure that the flexible behavior is available when required, it is necessary to support a flexible system in such a manner as to direct all motion to the preferred location. For example, to accommodate piping expansion in a long piping run, pipe lengths should be in axial alignment joined by properly gapped pipe couplings between two opposing anchors. When used in mechanical equipment rooms and on pump connections, flexible couplings will characteristically provide greater piping deflections than those generated by traditional piping methods when adequate additional support is provided. Flexible couplings do not clamp rigidly onto the pipe. Therefore, every joint minimizes noise and vibration transmission to the piping system generated by pumps or other equipment (in contrast to other joining methods). Independent laboratory tests have confirmed that three flexible couplings connected in a series reduce more vibration than do elastomeric-arch or corrugated flexible-metal hose-type vibration isolators. Welded, flanged, or threaded joints offer no vibration attenuation, so additional costly vibration control devices are required. Rigid Coupling. The second type of coupling is defined as rigid coupling. Rigid couplings positively clamp the pipe to create a rigid joint, so axial movement and deflection are eliminated. They are particularly useful on risers, mechanical rooms, horizontal runs with numerous branches, and other areas where flexibility is not desired. Proper rigid coupling installation provides system behavior characteristics similar to those of other rigid systems, so that all piping remains in strict alignment and is not subject to axial or angular movement during operation. Figure A9.12 is an exaggerated illustration of a rigid coupling. For this reason, systems installed with rigid couplings utilize support techniques similar to those used in traditional flanged and welded systems and do not require additional support as in a flexible system. ASME Pressure Piping Code Section B31.1, Power Piping, and B31.9, Building Services Piping, may be used as guidelines for supporting rigid systems. Risers consisting entirely of rigid couplings can be treated similarly to welded piping systems, and where thermal movement is required, expansion joints or offsets will be necessary to prevent piping system movement and damage to components. The piping systems using rigid couplings are obviously advantageous where rigidity is

A.430 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A9.12 Rigid coupling. desired, as in mechanical equipment rooms, long straight runs, and similar applica- tions. Using Flexible and Rigid Couplings in a Piping System. When both flexible and rigid couplings are utilized, the system designer can optimize hanger spacing, eliminate expansion loops and flex connectors, and incorporate rigidity and flexibil- tiy where desired. An example of such a system would be a pumping system which bridges two buildings via an underground line. At the pump end, rigidity may be desirable in the mechanical room to control piping motion, whereas within the straight piping run between buildings, flexible couplings are the most desirable to accommodate anticipated settlements or thermal movements. In the adjoining building for the distribution system, it may be advantageous to use a rigid system, as a high-joint intensity may require an extensive support system when flexible couplings are used. By designing risers and long straight runs with rigid and flexible couplings, the designer can make use of the rigidity of rigid couplings to reduce guiding requirements and the flexibility of flexible couplings to accommodate ther- mal movement as required. The use of flexible and rigid couplings provides a variety of benefits to the system designer, installer, and owner, which results in the most reliable system for most applications and makes the grooved method an excellent choice for joining pipe. Grooved Joint Gaskets Many factors must be considered in determining the optimum gasket for a specific service. The foremost consideration is temperature, along with concentration of product, duration of service, and continuity of service. Temperatures beyond the recommended limits have a degrading effect on the polymer. Therefore, there is a direct relationship between temperature, continuity of service, and gasket life. The piping system designer should also consider the gasket style that will provide the desired system performance. Three basic styles are shown in Fig. A9.13 The standard gasket style is suitable for most piping system applications. The FlushSeal� style is designed with a centrally located lip that seals the internal gasket cavity and minimizes the entrapment of system fluids or debris. The EndSeal�seals the pipe ends to virtually eliminate entrapment of system fluids and debris. The piping system designer should review the grooved joint manufacturer’s gasket styles and select the style most suited to his system design.

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.431 FIGURE A9.13 Gasket styles. Gasket Selection A variety of synthetic rubber gaskets are available to provide the option of grooved piping products for the widest range of applications. To assure the maximum life for the service intended, proper gasket selection and specification is essential. The compounding of synthetic rubbers is both a science and an art form. There are many gasket materials available from the various manufacturers of grooved pipe joints. The piping system designer should consult the manufacturer for gasket material recommendations about the grooved joint he has specified. The designer is further cautioned that in instances where a gasket is not affected by several substances used alone, their combination could adversely affect the gasket.

Piping System Design Considerations. Grooved mechanical-joint piping systems have some specific characteristics that are different from conventional threaded, welded, and flanged systems. When understood and properly utilized, the piping system designer can achieve well-designed, economical piping systems. As always, professional piping design practice must prevail. The following considerations should be reviewed during the piping system design. In all piping systems designs, piping system thermal growth must be considered. Common methods of accommodating grooved piping system movement are 1) to allow the system to free float. This design method allows the pipe to move in a desired direction through the use of anchoring or guidance; or 2) utilize the linear movement-deflection capabilities of flexible grooved couplings. The selection of either of these methods is dependent on the type of piping system and the designer’s preference. Since it is difficult to predict all system designs,

A.434 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS it is the intent here to call attention to the mechanical advantages of the grooved piping method and how it can be used to the piping system designer’s benefit. These examples are presented to stimulate thought and should not be considered as recommendations for a specific system. FIGURE A9.14 Free-Floating System Free-floating systems are piping systems which are allowed to thermally expand or contract without the use of expansion joints, provided that this movement does not cause bending-moment stresses at branch connections or is not harmful to joints and changes in direction or to parts of structures or other equipment. This can be accomplished by randomly installing joints or, if desired, by installing guides to control the direction of movement. The effects of pressure thrusts must be taken into account when utilizing flexible grooved couplings, as the pipe may move to the full extent of the available pipe end gaps when allowed to float. See Fig. A9.14 for pressure-thrust example.

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.435 The system designer should ensure that branch connections and offsets are sufficiently long so that the maximum angular deflection of the coupling is never exceeded and that it can accommodate the anticipated total movement of the pipes. Otherwise, the designer must anchor the system and direct movements. See Table A9.9 for recommended pipe alignment guide spacing. Flexible Grooved Couplings Utilizing Their Linear Movement and Deflection Capabilities When designing piping joined with flexible mechanical grooved type couplings, it is necessary to give consideration to certain characteristics of these couplings. These characteristics distinguish flexible groove-type couplings from other types and meth- ods of pipe joining. When this is understood, the designer can utilize the many advantages that these couplings provide. Linear and angular movement available at flexible grooved pipe joints is pub- lished for each coupling manufacturer. These values are theoretical maximums. For design purposes, these figures should be reduced by the following factors to allow for coupling and pipe groove tolerances. Linear and Angular Movement Tolerance NPS ³⁄₄–3¹⁄₂ (DN20-90)—Reduce published figures by 50 percent NPS 4 (DN100) and larger—Reduce published figures by 25 percent Standard roll grooved pipe will provide ¹⁄₂ the expansion-contraction or deflection capabilities of the same size standard cut grooved pipe The angular deflection available at a flexible grooved pipe joint is useful in simplifying and speeding system design and installation. Angular deflection or misalignment is calculated Reference Fig. A9.15 for sample diagram. Flexible grooved-type couplings allow angular flexibility and rotational move- ment to take place at joints.

If joints are to be maintained deflected, then lines must be anchored to restrain pressure thrusts and end pull forces, otherwise sufficient lateral force must be exerted to keep joint deflected. Lateral forces will always act on deflected joints due to internal pressure. A fully deflected joint will no longer be capable of providing the full linear movement normally available at the joint. The grooved piping method will not allow maximum linear and angular movement simultaneously at the same joint. If linear and angular movement are expected simultaneously, systems should be designed with sufficient joints to accommodate both, including allow- ance for recommended tolerances. Fig- ure A9.18 shows a typical arrangement used to accommodate simultaneous lin- ear and angular movement. For anchored systems, where pres- sure thrusts do not act to hold the joints in tension, or in systems where the joints have been intentionally deflected (e.g., curves), lateral restraint should be pro- FIGURE A9.18 Accommodating piping vided to prevent movement of the pipes expansion and deflection. due to pressure thrusts acting at deflec- tions. Lightweight hangers are not ade- quate in preventing sideways movement of pipes. It should be anticipated that small deflections will occur in all straight lines, and side thrusts will be exerted on the joints. An example of inadequate lateral restraint is shown in Fig. A9.19. Flexible couplings do not automatically provide for expansion or contraction of piping. In anchored systems, gaps must be set to handle combinations of expansion and contraction. In free-floating systems, offsets of sufficient length must be used to accommodate movement without overdeflecting joints. Design anchors to direct movement away from or to protect critical changes in direction, branch connections, and structure. Spacing and suitable types of supports should be considered in accommodating anticipated pipe movements. Refer to Table A9.10 for suggested support spacing for flexible and rigid coupled systems. Movement in piping systems due to thermal changes can be accommodated with the grooved piping method. Sufficient flexible joints must be available to accommodate anticipated movement, including movement tolerance. If anticipated movement will be greater than provided by the total number of joints in the system, additional expansion in the form of an expansion joint should be considered. The

A.444 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Expansion Loops Utilizing Flexible Couplings and Fittings Grooved piping offers the designer the advantage of using flexible couplings and fittings in expansion loops without inducing stresses in the pipes, elbows, or joints. The deflection capability of flexible couplings allows for thermal growth-contraction to be absorbed within the couplings at the elbows as the thermal forces induce deflection. It is important that rigid couplings are not used on expansion loops, as these couplings are not designed to accommodate angular deflection. As shown in Fig. A9.21a, a total of eight flexible couplings, four grooved 90� elbows, and three pipe spools are required to complete each expansion loop. As system temperature decreases and the pipe run contracts (see Fig. A9.21b), the loop expands, and the deflection capability of the couplings accommodates this movement. As system temperature increases (see Fig. A9.21c), the opposite effect occurs as the pipe run expands and the loop contracts with the couplings accommo- dating the deflection in the opposite direction. The amount of thermal expansion and contraction, �X, should be determined by the system designer based on the length of pipe run between anchors and the anticipated temperature changes from the installation temperature (see Table A9.11 for details). The angular deflection available at each coupling is a design characteris- tic inherent to the coupling size, style, and the type of groove—cut or roll grooved. The length of the perpendicular branches of the loop dimension A (see Figure A9.21a) is determined by the amount of expected pipeline expansion or contraction, �X, and the deflection available per joint. Dimension A should be the same on both sides of the loop. The length of the parallel branch of the expansion loop, Dimension B, is determined by �X, and it must be sufficiently long enough to prevent the elbows at the pipe run from butting during thermal ex- pansion. It is recommended that Dimension B be at least 2 in (50.8 mm) larger than �X. The designer can use Fig. A9.22, Expansion Loop Design, to aid in the design of expansion. These loops incorporate all the design information for each size of Victaulic Flexible Coupling, including the angular movement tolerance. The nomi- nal pipe size and either the design thermal expansion, �X, or the length of perpendic- ular branches, dimension A, must be known, and the other can be determined. It is essential for a properly functioning expansion loop that it be installed without any coupling deflection and that the pipeline be properly anchored and guided. Whenever possible, the expansion loop should be located adjacent to an anchor within four pipe diameters. The first and second alignment guides on the opposite side of the expansion loop should be located a maximum distance of 4 and 14 pipe diameters, respectively. Additional intermediate guides may be required throughout the system for pipe alignment. Refer to Table A9.9 for recommended spacing. If the expansion loop cannot be located adjacent to an anchor, guides should be installed on both sides of the unit, as mentioned. Example A9.3 Expansion Loop Calculation. Using the parameters established in Example A9.2, NPS 6 (DN 150) nominal pipe size and 3.75 in (95.2 mm) of total anticipated movement, refer to Fig. A9.22 to determine the length of perpendicular loop branches for both cut and roll groove pipe.

A.448 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS For cut groove pipe (Fig. A9.22) For roll groove pipe (Fig. A9.22) To provide an expansion loop for the described system, the two branches must be a minimum of 2.7 ft (0.82 m) and 5.4 ft (1.65 m) long for cut and roll groove pipe, respectively. The parallel branch of the expansion loop must be at least 2 in (50.8 mm) larger than �X. The simple system described in Example A9.2 and above accommodated thermal expansion through the use of flexible couplings and an expansion loop. We must also discuss the application of flexible couplings and rigid couplings with the use of main anchors, intermediate anchors, and guides to accommodate thermal move- ment and pressure thrust. Anchors Anchors can be used to prevent movement due to pressure thrust and thermal growth. There are two types of anchors which are commonly used: A. Main anchors B. Intermediate anchors Main anchors are installed at or near terminal points and changes of direction of a pipe line. The forces acting on a main anchor will result from internal pressure thrust and thermal growth. These forces can generate substantial loads which may require structural analysis. Intermediate anchors divide a long pipe run, with main anchors at each end, into individual expanding sections. The pressure thrust on the intermediate anchors cancel each other out. Where there is a change in pipe diameter, there will be a differential pressure thrust acting on an intermediate anchor. Typical examples of main and intermediate anchors are shown in Fig. A9.23. The following examples illustrate the mechanical advantages of the grooved piping method and how they can be utilized to the piping systems designer’s benefit. These are presented to stimulate thought and should not be considered as recom- mendations for a specific system. The grooved piping method, when used in a piping system, should always be utilized in designs consistent with good piping practice. Example A9.4 Anchor Locations. To properly restrain this system, reference Fig. A9.20 for Example 3 piping system sketch. It would be necessary to provide a pressure thrust anchor at ‘‘A’’ to prevent the piping outside the structure from being forced inside by the pressure thrust acting at the elbow ‘‘B.’’ Inside, it would be necessary to provide a hanger at point C1, or a base support at point C2. No

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.449 FIGURE A9.23 anchoring would be required, and the self-restraining feature of the joints would hold the piping securely together. Outside, it would be necessary to ensure that the maximum end load of the joints was not exceeded due to thermal movement of the pipes. Intermediate anchors may be required. The pipe must be properly supported and guided. Refer to Tables A9.9 and A9.10. Where flexible couplings are not required to accommodate thermal movement, rigid couplings can reduce supports and offsets. Example A9.5 Anchor and Guide Locations. Anchor at location D to support weight of pipe. Use hangers to support weight of piping. Anchors as well as guides may be required at B and C if flexible couplings are used as expansion joints. Refer to Fig. A9.20 for Example 4 piping system sketch. Example A9.6 Treatment of Risers with Branch Connections. Free-moving ris- ers can cause shear forces at branch connections due to pressure thrusts or thermal movement. The pipe should be anchored at or near the base with a main pressure thrust anchor, A, capable of supporting the full pressure thrust and local weight of pipe and fluids. Any movement of horizontal pipe at the bottom of the riser must

*Source: piping-handbook*

A.450 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS be considered independently, with adequate provision for movement. Refer to Fig. A9.20 for Example 5 piping system sketch. When flexible couplings are used, the system can be anchored at the top, B, with an anchor capable of withstanding full pressure thrust at the top of the riser plus local weight of pipe. The use of this upper anchor prevents any possibility of closed flexible joints opening under pressure and causing movement at the riser top. This method is often used for fire standpipe or similar systems where movement would cause shearing of intermediate components or branches. Piping between upper, B, and lower, A, anchors should be supported by interme- diate anchors, C, capable of supporting local pipe weight and preventing lateral movement. Intermediate anchors should be placed a minimum of every other ran- dom length of pipe. The system can be anchored at A also, and intermediate anchors at C can be used to support local pipe weight. Allowance for thermal movement should be considered, depending on application. Example A9.7 Treatment of Risers Without Branch Connection for Flexible Couplings. Reference Fig. A9.20 for Example 6 piping system sketch. With this method, a main thrust anchor is again needed at the bottom of the riser, A, which supports the total weight of pipe and fluids. Guidance is necessary at suitable intervals to prevent buckling of the riser. It is necessary that the pipe length, S, at the top of the stack be long enough to accommodate the total vertical movement. This movement is the result of the combined effect of pipe being moved to the full extent of the available pipe linear movement due to pressure thrusts and thermal growth. Rigid couplings also could be used to prevent linear movement due to pressure thrust. For offset S at the top of the riser to accommodate thermal growth, it would be necessary to use the proper number of flexible couplings to provide the angular deflection. Example A9.8 Treatment of Risers to Eliminate Concentrated Anchor Loads. Refer to Fig. A9.20 for Example 7 piping system sketch. When structural require- ments dictate that base anchor load or upper anchor load must be minimized, then the use of a looped system should be considered. In the system illustrated, each anchor carries the local weight of pipe. This method is often considered in tall buildings where high anchor loads would be generated. The offsets must be long enough to accommodate movement in the pipes due to flexible-coupling linear movement due to pressure thrust plus any thermal or other movements of pipes or supports. The use of rigid couplings could be considered to prevent linear move- ment due to pressure thrust. Offsets and Differential Settlement In many piping system designs, offsets or differential settlement must be considered. This is particularly important, as pipes pass from one structure to another. Flexible couplings offer the designer a method to accommodate offsets of pipe runs due to misalignment or building settlement. The offset transition can be achieved only with flexible couplings, as they allow for angular deflection at each joint.

*Source: piping-handbook*

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.451 FIGURE A9.24 Pipe displacement. Offsets are determined by the amount of lateral misalignment on the particular pipe run and the length along the pipe run that is required for the parallel shift of the run. In Fig. A9.24, these two parameters are shown as the Y-Displacement, lateral misalignment, and the X-Displacement, offset length, respectively. The pipe spools are first deflected in the direction of the misalignment until the midpoint of a particular pipe spool is more than half the required Y-Displacement. This spool then becomes a transition spool, as an equal number of couplings and pipe spools are required on either side of the transition spool to deflect the pipeline back to its original direction. A major objective in designing for a misalignment is to achieve the required Y- Displacement, using the minimum number of couplings. To this end, because of symmetry around a transition point, as explained earlier, the point of inflection is a pipe spool and not a coupling. Therefore, for all calculations and results in this section, an even number of couplings and an odd number of pipe spools have been used. Also, to maximize the deflection at each joint, cut-groove pipe should be considered. Should roll-grooved joints be used, then the deflection available will be one-half that of a cut-grooved joint. The number of couplings and the length of the pipe spools are the two variables that can be altered to obtain the desired misalignment. Other factors, such as the maximum angle of deflection at each coupling and the maximum pipe-end separation are a function of the size and style coupling being used. The following is a technical explanation of the formulas derived to calculate the number of couplings, spool length, X- and Y-Displacements. The geometric derivation to accommodate offsets starts with the deflection on one pipe spool from the pipe run at the angle, �(see Fig. A9.24). The Y- Displacement from the pipe-run centerline after the first deflected spool is shown as �Y1 �(L �a) sin �, where L is the length of the pipe spool and a is one-half the maximum pipe-end separation for the particular coupling to be used. As the second spool is connected and deflected, also at the angle, �, the total angle of deflection from the pipe run is ���, or 2�(see Fig. A9.25). The Y-Displacement due to the second coupling and pipe spool is �Y2 �(L �a) sin 2�.

A.452 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A9.25 Deflection of pipe. Since the length of each pipe spool is equal, then the total Y-Displacement to the end of the second pipe spool from the pipe run is the sum of each spool or When the value of �YTOTAL is at least half of the required Y-Displacement, then the last calculated pipe length up to that point becomes the point of transi- tion. Geometrical symmetry about this point allows that the actual Y-Displace- ment of the completed misalignment will be equal to two times the �YTOTAL up to the transition spool piece plus the Y-Displacement of the spool piece itself, or where P is the number of spool pieces to achieve the transition and is equal to one-half of the number of couplings involved in the total misalignment. This expression is mathematically simplified to:

A designer wants to connect a NPS 6 (DN150) feed main from an existing building to a new structure. There is 66 in (1676 mm) of pipe run between the connection points, and it is expected that a settlement of 3 in (76.2 mm) will occur. To utilize the maximum deflection available from flexible coupling, cut grooved-pipe nipples will be used. Requirements

A.454 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Not enough; Y-Displacement of 3 in (76.2 mm) is required, so try 6 couplings: With six NPS 6 (DN150) flexible couplings and five 12 in (300 mm) cut-groove pipe spools, the misalignment can be accommodated, attaining the required Y- Displacement in the limited X-Displacement. Earthquake Design Considerations Piping systems designed for earthquake prone areas must be analyzed for the movements and loads associated with these events. The grooved system provides many mechanical design features useful in systems subject to earthquake conditions. The inherent flexibility of flexible couplings acts to reduce the transmission of stresses throughout the piping system, and the resilient gasket aids to further reduce

*Source: piping-handbook*

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.455 the transmission of vibration. Where flexibility is not desired, rigid couplings can be used. As a general practice, seismic bracing and piping supports are utilized in piping systems to prevent excessive movement by controlling and directing system move- ment during a seismic occurrence which would result in overstressing the piping system. In a similar manner, piping supports for a grooved piping system must limit pipe movements such that they do not exceed the recommended allowable deflections and end loads. An excellent reference source, which covers these piping systems, is NFPA 13 Installation of Sprinkler Systems. This standard requires sprin- kler systems to be protected to minimize or prevent pipe breakage where subject to earthquakes. This is accomplished by using two techniques: ●Making the piping flexible where necessary by use of flexible couplings ●Affixing the piping to the building structure for minimum relative movement by using sway bracing Flexibility is provided by using flexible couplings joining grooved end pipe and swing joints. ‘‘Rigid-Type’’ mechanical couplings, which do not permit movement at the grooved connection, are not considered flexible couplings. Rigid couplings are used in horizontal piping for purposes other than the requirements of earthquake protection. Where large pipe movements are anticipated, seismic swing joints are made up using flexible grooved couplings, pipe nipples and grooved elbows, as shown in Fig. A9.26. Product Applications The use of grooved piping systems has become widespread throughout the world. Applications of these joints come from all commercial, industrial, and municipal areas. Grooved joints are being used from NPS ³⁄₄ (DN 20) to NPS 100 (DN 2500). Applications are limited by the pressure, temperature, and system media. Each manufacturer of grooved piping joints has published pressure and temperature ratings of their various style couplings and gaskets. The piping system designer should consult this information to assure proper systems design. The piping system designer can expect to find joints and gaskets available to accommodate temperatures from �30�F (�34�C) to 300�F (140�C) and pressures of up to 1000 psi (6900 kPa) and above. Materials of construction are normally ductile cast iron; however, couplings are also available in stainless steel, aluminum, and other castable materials, as special applications may require. Grooved systems can utilize pipe made of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, PVC, fiberglass, ductile iron and lined ductile iron, and steel, or any metallic or nonmetallic material that can be grooved. Benefits of Grooved Piping Systems Grooved piping systems offer a number of benefits when designed and installed properly. ●Grooved systems provide the designer the choice of flexible and rigid joints. The system can be designed to be flexible, allowing for expansion, contraction, and

Rigid couplings can be included in the system design to provide rigidity to minimize pipe supports. ●Grooved piping systems provide dampening of system vibration. The prevention of the transmission of objectionable vibration induced by piping systems to the building structure has become increasingly crucial, as vibration induced noise is a major complaint by building occupants. ●A properly designed grooved piping system will normally result in a lower installa- tion cost to the facility owner. Piping is prepared rapidly through roll grooving. Installation is accomplished with simple hand tools and standard pipe-fitting techniques. Takeout dimensions for fittings and valves are consistent, thus pipes can be roll grooved at ground level and then lifted into place and coupled into the system. Where the designer chooses, piping can be prefabricated off site. In either case, installation is much more rapid when compared to welding or thread- ing. In most cases, this speed of installation will result in a more cost-effective system.

GROOVED AND PRESSFIT PIPING SYSTEMS A.457 ●Where piping must be removed for replacement or maintenance, the grooved system should be the system of choice. With each joint becoming a union, a grooved system is the easiest and quickest piping system to service. Flanges for the same size pipe have many more bolts to remove and replace, and a new gasket is always needed. A grooved coupling is removed more rapidly because it has fewer bolts. The bolts and gasket are readily reusable unless they have been damaged.

CHAPTER A10 PART 1 SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF VALVES Mohinder L. Nayyar, P.E. ASME Fellow INTRODUCTION Valves are an essential part of any piping system that conveys liquids, gases, vapors, slurries and mixtures of liquid, and gaseous phases of various flow media. Starting with primitive means for stopping, allowing, or diverting water-flow from a source through shallow or deep channels, such as wooden or stone wedges stuck between the edges of a water passage, man has developed several different types of simple and sophisticated valve designs. Different types of valves include: gate, globe, check, ball, plug, butterfly, diaphragm, pinch, pressure relief, and control valves. Each of these types has several categories and designs, each offering different features and functional capabilities. Some valves are self-actuated while others are manually operated or have actuators that are powered with electric motors, are pneumatic or hydraulic, or a combination to operate the valve. Valves are manufactured with metals and nonmetals. Valves are used in industrial piping systems, transportation and distribution pipelines, building services piping, civic facilities, and irrigation piping systems. The piping systems of industrial, commercial, residential, and other civic facilities carry the lifeblood of modern civilization, like arteries and veins. And the valves in those piping systems serve the functions of allowing, stopping, regulating, and controlling the flow, to fulfill the intended objectives of the system. When fluid pressure builds up beyond a set limit, the valves relieve the overpressure to safeguard the integrity of the piping system or a component. Valves help in maintaining or breaking a vacuum. Valves also assist in maintaining the pressure or temperature of the flow medium within the desired range or limit. In order to select a suitable valve for a particular application, the user must evaluate the valve characteristics, including the design features, materials of construction, and performance, in light of specific application requirements: flow medium, process design requirements, piping design criteria, and economic factors. This chapter provides a brief discussion of topics considered in the selection and application of commonly used valves. A.459

A.460 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS VALVE TERMINOLOGY Actuator: A device that operates a valve by utilizing electricity, pneumatics, hydrau- lics, or a combination of one or more of these energies. Sometimes actuators are referred to as operators. In this chapter, the word operator will be used for a person who operates any equipment, machine, plant, or system. Ambient conditions: The pressure and temperature of the environment surrounding a valve. Backflow: The flow that occurs in the opposite direction of the normal or expected fluid flow. Back pressure: The static pressure existing at the outlet of a pressure-relief device due to pressure in the discharge system. Backseat: A seat on the bonnet or bonnet bushing which contacts a corresponding seating surface of the stem or disc holder when the stem is fully retracted. It provides a seal between the stem and the inside of the bonnet. It prevents leakage of flow medium and allows replacement of valve packing while the valve is open and under pressure. Block-and-bleed valve: A valve with two seating surfaces which provide simultane- ous blockage of flow from both valve ends, and means for draining or venting the cavity between the seating surfaces. When the valve is closed (blocked) the drain is opened, allowing the trapped fluid between the seats to drain (bleed). Block valve: A valve that is used to start or stop the flow. It is also referred to as an on-off valve. Blowdown: The difference between the set pressure and the disc-reseating pressure of a pressure-relief valve, which is expressed as a percentage of the set pressure. Blowdown valve: A valve used to release the pressurized contents of a pressure vessel or piping. Bonnet: A valve body closure component that contains an opening for the stem. Bore: The diameter of the smallest opening through a valve. It is also called port. Bubble tight: A valve is termed bubble tight when the upstream side of the valve is pressurized with air and the downstream side is filled with water and no air bubbles are detected on the downstream side with the valve in fully closed position. Bypass: A piping loop provided to permit flow around the flow control element (disc, plug, etc.) of a valve in its closed position. A stop valve installed in the bypass loop is called the bypass valve. Cavitation: This occurs when the fluid pressure at the vena contracta falls below the vapor pressure, followed by pressure recovery above the vapor pressure. The pressure below vapor pressure causes vapor bubbles to form, which then collapse as the pressure recovers. Collapsing bubbles can cause erosion of valve and down- stream pipe metal surfaces. The phenomena of fluid pressure falling below and recovering above vapor pressure, combined with forming and collapsing of bubbles, is termed cavitation. Chatter: Abnormal rapid reciprocating motion of the movable parts of a pressure- relief valve in which the disc contacts the seat. Choked flow: When the flow rate cannot be increased even if the downstream pressure is decreased. In liquid applications, it is caused by vapor bubbles, formed by cavitation or flashing, choking the flow passage. In the case of gases, choked

*Source: piping-handbook*

PART 1 SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF VALVES A.461 flow is caused when the flow velocity reaches sonic proportions and a reduction in downstream pressure cannot increase the gas flow. Closing pressure: The pressure equal to the valve of decreasing inlet static pressure at which the valve disc reestablishes contact with the seat or at which lift becomes zero. Coefficient of discharge: The ratio of the measured relieving capacity to the theoreti- cal relieving capacity of a pressure-relief valve. Coefficient of flow: The flow rate that passes through the fully open valve at unit pressure differential. It is measured in gal (3.8 liters) per minute of 60�F (16�C) water with 1 psi (6.9 kPa) pressure differential. It is also referred to as flow coefficient or valve coefficient. Cold working pressure (CWP): This is the maximum flow-medium pressure at the ambient temperature to which the valve may be subjected during normal service. This is also referred to as water-oil-gas (WOG) rating. Control valve: A valve serving as a control element in a system, providing means for varying the rate of flow of the fluid passing through the valve. Cracking pressure: The upstream fluid pressure at which a closed check valve starts to open and allow the flow through the valve. Cryogenic valve: A valve used in applications with fluid temperatures below �50�F (�45�C). A cryogenic valve is provided with an extended stem contained in an extension tube so that the valve packing and operator remain at ambient tempera- ture when the cryogenic fluid is in the valve body. The valve is oriented so that the packing is at a higher elevation than the valve body. It allows a vapor-gas pocket to form inside the extension tube, thereby making the extension tube more effective at insulating the packing from cryogenic fluid cold temperature. Disc: The part of the valve which is positioned in the flow stream to permit or to obstruct flow, depending on closure position. In specific designs, it may also be called a wedge, plug, ball, gate, or other functionally similar expression. In international standards it is referred to as obturator. Double-disc: A two-piece disc or two separate discs that mate with two seating surfaces. Double discs are used in some designs of gate valves. Double-seated valve: A valve with two separate seating surfaces that come in contact with two separate seating surfaces of a disc or a double disc. Flow characteristic: Defines the relationship between the Flow Coefficient and the valve stroke. Flow coefficient: See Coefficient of flow. Flow control element: The part of the valve that allows, stops, obstructs, and controls the fluid flow through the valve. See Disc. Fugitive emission: The amount of leakage of hazardous and toxic flow medium (fluids) from a valve to the environment. Full bore: When valve bore (port) is approximately of the same size as the inside diameter of the connecting pipe, it is called full bore (full port). Fully stellited: A valve is termed fully stellited when seating surfaces of the valve seat(s) and the disc(s) are hard faced with wear and corrosion-resistant material (Stellite or other such material). Half stellited: A valve is termed half stellited when only the seating surfaces of the valve seat(s) are hard faced with wear and corrosion-resistant material (Stellite or other such material).

Lantern ring: A spacer ring used in the lantern ring type of packing chamber to permit lubrication of the packing, purging of the shaft or stem, or a leak-off system. Leak-off connection: A pipe or tube connected to a hole in the stuffing box at the level of lantern ring. It is used to collect leakage past a lower set of lantern ring–type of packing or to inject lubricant into the stuffing box. Linear-flow characteristics: A flow characteristic of the valve when the flow is directly proportional to the position of the flow control element. Liner: Lining of protective materials applied on the inside surfaces of valve body (or valve trim) to enhance resistance to corrosion, erosion, or contamination. Nonreturn valve: Stop-check valve, a check valve in which the closure member can be mechanically closed. Nonrising stem: Refer to Inside screw, nonrising stem (ISNRS). Outside-screw-and-yoke (OS&Y): A valve design in which the threaded portion of the stem is outside the pressure boundary of the valve. The valve bonnet has a yoke, which holds a nut through which the rotating stem rises as the valve is opened. The stem part inside the valve is smooth and is sealed so that stem threads are isolated from the flow medium. Pilot operated pressure relief valve: A pressure-relief valve in which the major relieving device is combined with and controlled by a self-actuated auxiliary pres- sure-relief valve. Port: See bore. Power actuated pressure-relief valve: A pressure-relief valve in which the major relieving device is combined and controlled by a device requiring an external source of energy. Quarter-turn valve: A valve whose closure member rotates approximately a quarter turn (90�) to move from full-open to full-closed position. Reduced port: Valve port smaller than the inside diameter of the end-connecting pipe. It is approximately equal to the inside diameter of the one pipe size smaller than the end size for gate valves, and 60 percent of full bore on ball valves. Regular port: A valve port smaller than the full bore, approximately 75 to 90 percent of full bore on ball valves and 60 to 70 percent on plug valves. Relief valve: A pressure-relief valve actuated by inlet static pressure and having a gradual lift generally proportional to the increase in pressure over the opening pressure (set pressure). Rotary motion valve: A valve that involves a quarter-turn motion to open or close the valve closure element. Rupture disc: A nonclosing pressure-relief device actuated by inlet static pressure and designed to function by the bursting of a pressure-containing disc.

Safety valve: A pressure-relief valve actuated by inlet static pressure and character- ized by rapid opening or pop action. Seat: The portion of the valve against which the closure member presses to ef- fect shutoff. Seat ring: A separate piece inserted in the valve body to form a seat against which the valve-closure member engages to effect shut-off. Set pressure: The inlet static pressure of the system at which a relief valve starts to open, or safety valve pops open. Short pattern valve: A valve that has face-to-face or end-to-end dimension for a short pattern design according to standard ASME B16.10. Steam working pressure (SWP): The maximum rated or working pressure corre- sponding to the steam temperature that must not be exceeded when valve is used in steam service. It is marked with S, SP, or SWP on the valve. Stroke: The amount of travel the valve-closure member is capable of from a fully closed position to a fully open position or vice versa. In linear-motion valves it is expressed in in (mm) and in degrees, 0 to 90, for rotary motion valves. Throttling: The process of regulating the fluid flow rate or pressure by controlling the position of the closure member between the full-open and full-closed positions. Trim: Functional parts of a valve which are exposed to the line fluid. Usually refers to the stem, closure member and, seating surfaces. The removable or replaceable valve metal internal parts that come in contact with the flow medium are collectively known as valve trim. Valve parts such as body, bonnet, yoke, and similar items are not considered trim. Venturi port: A valve bore or port that is substantially smaller than the full port, approximately 40 to 50 percent of full port. It is normally found in plug valves. Wafer body: A valve body that has a short face-to-face dimension in relation to pipeline diameter and is designed to be installed between two flanges using special length studs and nuts. Wedge: A gate valve–closure member with inclined sealing surfaces which come in contact with valve-seating surfaces that are inclined to the stem centerline. Wedge is available in solid, split, and flex designs. Yoke: That part of the valve assembly used to position the stem nut or to mount the valve actuator.

CLASSIFICATION OF VALVES The following are some of the commonly used valve classifications: Classification Based on Mechanical Motion Based on the mechanical or cyclical motion of the valve closure member, valves are classified as follows: Linear Motion Valves. The valves in which the closure member, as in gate, globe, diaphragm, pinch, and lift check valves, moves in a straight line to allow, stop, or throttle the flow. Table A10.1 lists the valves based on motion of valve-closure member. Rotary Motion Valves. When the valve-closure member travels along an angular or circular path, as in butterfly, ball, plug, eccentric- and swing check valves, the valves are called rotary motion valves. See Table A10.1.

When a swing check valve is provided with the external means to close and maintain the valve disc in a closed position, it can be used as a stop check valve. Quarter Turn Valves. Some rotary motion valves require approximately a quarter turn, 0 through 90�, motion of the stem to go to fully open from a fully closed position or vice versa. Refer to Table A10.1. Classification Based on Valve Size Valve Size. Valve size is denoted by the nominal pipe size (NPS), which is equal to the size of valve-connecting ends or the flange-end size. In the metric system, valve size is designated by the nominal diameter (DN) of connecting pipe or the connecting flange ends. When a valve is installed with reducers on each end, the size of the valve will be equal to the size of the reducer-connecting ends attached to the valve. The valve size is not necessarily equal to the inside diameter of the valve. It is a normal industry practice to categorize valves, based upon size, in two classification: small and large.

PART 1 SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF VALVES A.471 Small Valves. NPS 2 (DN 50) and smaller valves are called small valves. At times, NPS 2¹⁄₂ (DN 65) and smaller valves are referred to as small valves. As such, the size classification can vary and, therefore, it should not be considered a uniform industry practice. Large Valves. NPS 2¹⁄₂ (DN 65) and larger valves are classified as large valves. As indicated earlier, NPS 2¹⁄₂ (DN 65) valves may be designated as small valves, depending on the criteria used in classifying small valves. Classification Based on Pressure-Temperature Rating Class Ratings. Pressure-temperature ratings of valves are designated by class numbers. Based on the material(s) of construction, the pressure-temperature ratings for each class are tabulated to provide the maximum allowable working pressures, expressed as gauge pressures, at the temperature shown. The temperature shown TABLE A10.2 ASME B16.34 Classification of Valves and Limitations Class 150 300 400 600 900 1500 2500 45001 Standard2 X X X X X X X X Special3 X X X X X X X X Limited4,5 X X X X X X X X Intermediate6 X X X X X X X X Butt welding X X X X X X X X Socket welding4,7 X X X X X X X X Flanged8 Std Std Std Std Std Std Std Threaded4,7,9 X X X X X X X 1 Class 4500 applies only to welding end valves. 2 Valves conforming to the requirements of ASME B16.34, for standard class valves.

Ratings shall not exceed the values shown in those Tables 2 having an identifying Suffix ‘‘B.’’ (ASME B16.34). Special Class ratings shall not be used for flanged-end valves. 4 Welding- or threaded-end valves in sizes NPS 2-1/2 and smaller that conform to the requirements of Annex G (ASME B16.34) may be designated Limited Class valves. Limited Class ratings shall not be used for flanged end valves. 5 Threaded-end valves rated above Class 2500 and socket-end valves rated above Class 4500 are not within the scope of ASME B16.34. 6 A welding- or threaded-end valve may be assigned an intermediate pressure and temperature rating or Class, either Standard or Special, in accordance with paragraph 6.1.4 of ASME B16.34, provided all applicable requirements of this standard are met. 7 Threaded and socket-welding-end valves larger than NPS 2-1/2 are beyond the scope of ASME B16.34. 8 Flanged-end valves shall be rated as Standard Class. 9 A class designation greater than Class 2500 or a rating temperature greater than 1000�F applied to threaded-end valves is beyond the scope of ASME B16.34.

A.474 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS for a corresponding pressure rating is the temperature of the pressure-containing shell of the component. Items such as a piping system or a portion thereof, a pump, tank, heat exchanger, pressure vessel, valves, et cetera are considered components. ASME B16.34, Valves—Flanged, Threaded, and Welding End is one of the most widely used valve standards. It defines three types of classes: standard, special, and limited. ASME B16.34 covers Class 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, 2500, and 4500 valves. It also allows valves to be classified as intermediate whose pressure- temperature ratings may fall within those listed for the standard and special class valves. See Table A10.2 for valve classifications and their limitations covered by ASME B16.34. Refer to Table A1.2 in Chapter A1 for metric equivalent (PN) of valve classifications. Tables A10.3 and A10.4 provide a listing of valve classes covered by various commonly used valve standards published by the Manufacturers Standardization Society (MSS) and the American Petroleum Institute (API). Table A10.5 provides a brief summary of valves covered by AWWA standards. Cold Working Pressure (CWP) Rating. Valves are also rated by the CWP rating. This rating represents the maximum allowable working pressure at the ambient temperature to which the valve may be subjected in normal service. Sometimes it is referred to as cold rating. The pressure rating of a valve at �20 to 100�F (�29 to 38�C), as listed in ASME B16.34 and other valve standards, is considered cold working pressure (CWP) or cold rating. CWP is also designated as the water-oil- gas (WOG) rating. Valves marked with CWP or WOG rating are primarily intended for applications in which the flow medium is maintained at ambient temperature, such as, but not limited to, water, oil, and gas distribution and transmission systems. NFPA Rating. Valves to be used in fire protection systems in the United States are required to be rated for fire service. These valves are rated for 175 and 250 psi (1210 and 1725 kPa), and they are designated as UL (Underwriters Laboratories) listed and FM (Factory Mutual) approved. A valve rated for 175 psi (1210 kPa) for fire protection service may also be rated for higher pressure marked as CWP or Water Working Pressure (WWP) for general service. As such, a fire-rated valve may be used at pressures higher than fire service rating in applications termed as general service. General Service Rating. The general service rating may be considered to be the equivalent of the CWP rating. Some valve manufacturers assign two ratings, fire rating and general service rating, to a valve. A UL-listed and FM-approved valve rated for 175 psig (1210 kPa) may have a general service rating of 400 psig (2760 kPa) at ambient temperature. It means that this valve can be used in a fire protection system having a maximum allowable working pressure of 175 psi (1210 kPa) or less, whereas it can be used in other services termed as general services and be subjected to a maximum allowable working pressure of 400 psig (2760 kPa). One must classify the service in accordance with the code of construction, as required. If the service does not fall within the jurisdiction of a code, then prudent engineering judgment may be followed in selecting the valve. Steam Working Pressure (SWP) Rating. The SWP rating of a valve is intended to define the maximum working pressure corresponding to the steam temperature. A valve assigned a SWP rating must not be used in steam service at pressures and temperatures exceeding the rating. Dual or Multiple Ratings. A valve may be assigned one or more ratings by the valve manufacturer. Ratings assigned must be marked on the valve. The marking

A.478 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS on the valve must be in accordance with the applicable valve standard or standards. A valve may comply with one or more valve standards. For example, a Class 600, NPS 4 (DN 100), butt-welding end, steel gate valve complying with ASME B16.34 may be marked as Class 800 valve in accordance with API Standard 603, provided the valve complies with the design and construction requirements of both ASME B16.34 and API 603. Some valve manufacturers may have proprietary design valves that are rated for specialty applications. Dual- or multiple-rated valves may be used within the pressure-temperature rating(s) conforming to the valve standard referenced in the code of jurisdiction under which the system is designed and constructed. Dual- or multiple-rated valves have increased utility and broad market. The manufacturer benefits from reduced design and production costs. MAJOR VALVE PARTS Pressure Retaining Parts Valve body, bonnet or cover, disc, and body-bonnet bolting are classified as pressure- retaining parts of a valve. The following provides a brief description of these parts: Body. The valve body houses the internal valve parts and provides the passage for fluid flow. The valve body may be cast, forged, fabricated, or made by a combina- tion of cast, forged, or fabricated portions. Valve bodies can be and are made from a variety of metals and alloys. Also, valve bodies can be and are made of nonmetals; however, these must be within certain size and pressure-rating limits. The valve-body ends are designed to connect the valve to the piping or equipment nozzle by different types of end connections, such as butt or socket-welded, threaded, flanged or bolted, soldered, brazed, solvent cement joint, mechanical joint, or cou- pling. Refer to Table A10.6. Bonnet or Cover. The bonnet or cover is fastened to the valve body to complete the pressure-retaining shell. In case of gate, globe, stop check, and diaphragm valves, it contains an opening for the valve stem to pass through. Usually, it contains a stuffing box. It provides access to valve internals, especially when the valve is installed. The top works of valves include bonnet, yoke, and operating mechanism. The bonnet is the base that supports the valve top works. The valve bonnet is attached to the valve body by many different types of joints: bolted, pressure-seal joints—breach lock and standard pressure seal joints— threaded, welded, union joint, and clamp seal. Some valves have a bonnetless design in which valve body and bonnet are combined into one. This is also known as an integral bonnet. The bolted bonnet design is commonly used with cast or ductile iron, cast or forged steel, and alloy valves, which are rated NPS 2¹⁄₂ (DN 65) and larger, and Class 600 and below. Valves with a pressure seal–bonnet design are usually manufac- tured in Class 600 and higher rating classifications and are considered superior in regard to the leaktightness of the body bonnet joint. Bolted bonnet designs are also produced in valves rated Class 900 and higher. The user needs to consider the potential consequences of flow-medium leakage through body bonnet joints and take the necessary measures to prevent or contain the leakage.

Bonnet or Cover Bolting. Bolting includes bolts, nuts, and washers. The bolting to be used must be made from materials acceptable for the application in accordance with the applicable code, standard, specification, or the governing regulation. Refer to the applicable valve standard for acceptable bolting materials. Disc. The disc is the part which allows, throttles, or stops flow, depending on its position. In the case of a plug or a ball valve, the disc is called plug or a ball. A valve disc could be cast, forged, or fabricated. A disc is seated against the stationary valve seat or seats when the valve is in the closed position. It can be moved away from the valve seat(s) by motion of the valve stem, with the exception of check and safety-relief valves, in which the disc is moved away from its seat(s) by fluid flow and pressure. At times some users do not consider the valve disc to be a pressure-retaining or -containing part. The reasoning advanced is that when the valve is in an open position, the disc does not perform a pressure-retaining or -containing functions. However, when the same valve is closed, the disc performs pressure-retaining functions. Refer to Table A10.7 for disc materials. Valve Trim. The removable and replaceable valve internal parts that come in contact with the flow medium are collectively termed as valve trim. These parts include valve seat(s), disc, glands, spacers, guides, bushings, and internal springs. The valve body, bonnet, packing, et cetera that also come in contact with the flow medium are not considered valve trim.

Bushings and pack- ing glands do not experience the same forces and conditions as do the valve disc and seat(s). Flow-medium properties, chemical composition, pressure, temperature, flow rate, velocity and viscosity are some of the important considerations in selecting suitable trim materials. Trim materials may or may not be the same material as the valve body or bonnet.

PART 1 SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF VALVES A.481 API has standardized trim materials by assigning a unique number to each set of trim materials. Refer to Table A10.8 for API trim materials. Nonpressure Retaining Parts. Valve seat(s), stem, yoke, packing, gland bolting, bushings, handwheel, and valve actuators are some of the major nonpressure- retaining parts of a valve. Valve Seat(s). A valve may have one or more seats. In the case of a globe or a swing-check valve, there is usually one seat, which forms a seal with the disc to stop the flow. In the case of a gate valve, there are two seats; one on the upstream side and the other on the downstream side. The gate-valve disc or wedge has two seating surfaces that come in contact with the valve seats to form a seal for stopping the flow. Multiport plug and ball valves may have several seats, depending upon the number of ports in the plug or ball. The valve leakage rate is directly proportional to the effectiveness of the seal between the valve disc and its seat(s). The valve standards MSS SP 61, API 598, and ASME B16.34 specify acceptable leak rates. A user may specify more or less restrictive leak rates to satisfy the application requirements. Valve manufacturers have developed several designs of combination valve seats involving elastomer and metal seats that are effective in achieving the desired leaktightness, which is not readily accomplished with metal seats. Valve seats may be integral, replaceable, or renewable seat rings. Small valves generally are provided with screwed-in, swaged-in, welded, or brazed-in valve seats. Large valves may have any of the seat designs listed for small valves, or have seats integrally cast or forged with the valve body and hardened by heat treatment or surfaced with hard material such as Stellite. Stellite is a trade name of the Deloro Company. There are other metals that can be used for hardening the seating surfaces. Galling Prevention. In order to prevent or minimize galling of the valve disc and valve seats, it is common industry practice to maintain a hardness differential between the stationary seating surfaces of valve seats and the moving seating surfaces of the valve disc. The stationary valve seats are hardened slightly more than the disc-seating surfaces. When both the valve seats and the disc are hardened by use of Stellite, the valve is termed fully stellited. When only the seats are hardened by use of Stellite, the valve is called half stellited. Heat treatment is another method of hardening. Valve Stem. The valve stem imparts the required motion to the disc, plug, or the ball for opening or closing the valve. It is connected to the valve handwheel, actuator, or the lever at one end and the valve disc on the other. In gate or globe valves, linear motion of the disc is needed to open or close the valve, while in plug, ball, and butterfly valves, the valve disc is rotated to open or close the valve. With the exception of stop-check valves, check valves do not have valve stems. Rising Stem with Outside Screw and Yoke. The outermost part of the stem is threaded, while the portion of stem inside the valve is smooth. The stem threads are isolated from the flow medium by the stem packing. Two different styles of this design are available: one having the handwheel fixed to the stem so that they rise together, and the other having a threaded sleeve that causes the stem to rise through the handwheel. The rising stem with outside screw and yoke (O. S. & Y.) is a common design for NPS 2 (DN 50) and larger valves. Some codes, such as ASME B31.1, Power Piping, require that an outside screw-and-yoke design be used

A.484 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS FIGURE A10.1 Rising-stem solid-wedge gate FIGURE A10.2 Nonrising stem gate valve for valve for 250-psig steam service. 250-psig steam service. for NPS 3 (DN 80) and larger valves in pressures above 600 psi (4140 kPa). See Fig. A10.1. Rising Stem with Inside Screw. The threaded part of the stem is inside the valve body, and the stem packing is along the smooth part that is exposed to the atmo- sphere outside. In this case the stem threads are in contact with the flow medium. When rotated, the stem and the handwheel rise together to open the valve. This design is commonly used in the smaller-sized low-to-moderate pressure gate, globe, and angle valves. Nonrising Stem with Inside Screw. The threaded part of the stem is inside the valve and does not rise. The valve disc travels along the stem like a nut when the stem is rotated. Stem threads are exposed to the flow medium and, as such, are subjected to its impact. Therefore, this design is used where space is limited to allow linear stem movement, and the flow medium does not cause erosion, corrosion, or wear and tear of stem material. See Fig. A10.2. Sliding Stem. This stem does not rotate or turn. It slides in and out of the valve to close or open the valve. This design is used in hand-lever–operated quick- opening valves. It is also used in control valves that are operated by hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders. Rotary Stem. This is a commonly used design in ball, plug, and butterfly valves. A quarter-turn motion of the stem opens or closes the valve. Stem Packing. Stem packing performs one or both of the following two functions, depending on the application: ●Prevent leakage of flow medium to the environment ●Prevent outside air from entering the valve in vacuum applications

*Source: piping-handbook*

PART 1 SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF VALVES A.485 Stem packing is contained in a part called the stuffing box. Packing rings are packed and compressed by tightening a packing nut or packing gland bolts. Compres- sion must be adequate to achieve a good seal. Sometimes it requires regular inspec- tion and tightening of packing rings, if required, to stop leakage. If this does not stop the leakage, the packing may need to be replaced. Belleville washers are used to maintain live loading, or the required compression of packing to achieve an effective seal against leakage. A stuffing box may be provided with some or all of the following features as dictated by the valve application: ●Two sets of packing rings separated by an intermediate lantern ring ●A bottom junk ring ●A leak-off connection which detects leakage past the lower set of packing rings and is piped off to a leakage collection tank ●A blow-off connection for removal of packing rings using compressed air ●Belleville washer, live loading ●A steam-seal connection, where an external steam supply is used to prevent leakage from the packing chamber ●As an alternate to steam-seal connection, a grease or sealant-seal connection used to prevent loss of vacuum within the valve ●Inverted-V packing for vacuum service Figure A10.3a shows a standard graphite packing arrangement; Figure A10.3b depicts the inverted Teflon packing arrangement for vacuum service; Figure A10.3c reflects a lantern-ring packing arrangement; and Figure A10.3d shows a live-loading packing system. Stem Protector. In the case of outside-screw-and yoke rising-stem gate and globe valves, a portion of the threaded valve stem is exposed to the outside environment when the valve is in the open position. Airborne dirt and other substances may be deposited on the exposed portion of the threaded stem and impair its smooth operation or shorten its stem-bushing life. A stem protector in the form of a clear plastic sleeve, tubing, or a pipe with a cap at the end is installed to protect the stem. The length of the stem protector must be adequate to allow full stem travel. Back Seat. Back seat is comprised of a shoulder on the stem and a mating surface on the underside of the bonnet. It forms a seal when the stem is in the fully open position. It prevents leakage of flow medium from the valve shell into the packing chamber and consequently to the environment. Back seat enables dismantling of the valve beyond the bonnet, without disrupting the fluid flow through the valve. In addition, it allows the replacing of the stuffing box while the valve is in service. Yoke. Yoke is also called yoke arms. It connects the valve body or bonnet with the actuating mechanism. In some cases, it provides support for the gland-pull- down bolts. On many valves, the yoke and bonnet are designed as one-piece con- struction. The top of the yoke holds a yoke nut, stem nut, or yoke bushing and the valve stem passes through it. See Fig. A10.1. For power-actuated valves, the yoke arms are of a heavier construction to provide adequate support to the actuator. The yoke usually has openings or windows to allow access to the stuffing box, position-switch dogs, actuator couplings, et cetera.

A.488 PIPING FUNDAMENTALS Structurally, a yoke must be sturdy enough to withstand forces, moments, and torque developed by the actuator. Yoke Bushings. An internally threaded nut held in the top of a yoke through which the valve stem passes. In gate and diaphragm valves, the yoke nut is turned and the stem travels up or down depending upon the direction of rotation of the nut. In the case of globe valves, the nut is held fixed and the stem is rotated through it. Usually, the yoke nut or yoke bushing is made of softer material than the stem for valves requiring medium effort to actuate. Valves which require greater effort to open or close are provided with anti-freeze yoke-sleeve bearings that minimize the friction between the hardened stem and the yoke bushing. MATERIALS Each of the valve standards listed in the beginning of this chapter lists material specifications which are acceptable for construction of valves covered by the stan- dard. At times, a valve standard may make reference to other standard(s) which list the acceptable materials. One of the most widely used valve standards is ASME B16.34. It lists three groups of acceptable materials that are further subdivided into several subgroups. Valve bodies, discs, and bonnets may be made from forgings, castings, or fabri- cated from combination of plate materials and others. Stems are usually produced from bar stock. Stems may be heat treated to provide needed hardness. Tubular materials are also used to make valve parts. Valve bodies and trim materials may be totally different. For example, cast iron body valve may have stainless steel or bronze trim. Sometimes, the discs may be electroplated or lined to provide protection against corrosion. Refer to Tables A10.3, A10.4, A10.5, A10.7, and A10.8 for lists of valve materials. For additional listing of acceptable valve materials, refer to valve standards and the code of jurisdiction. VALVE CATEGORIES Stop (Isolation) Valves As the name implies, stop valves are used to stop flow or isolate a portion of the system until it is desirable to achieve flow downstream of the valve. The basic design requirement of stop valves is to offer minimum resistance to flow in the fully open position and to exhibit tight shut-off characteristics when fully closed. Gate, globe, ball, butterfly, plug, and diaphragm valves satisfy the above require- ments in varying degrees and, therefore, are widely used in shut-off service. The actual type of valve selected is dictated by several parameters, including: ●Pressure drop ●Seat leakage ●Fluid properties

*Source: piping-handbook*

PART 1 SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF VALVES A.489 ●System leakage ●Actuation requirements ●Initial cost ●Maintenance Regulating Valves Regulating valves are used extensively in piping systems to regulate the flow of fluid. Whether the desired effect is to control flow, pressure, or temperature, the task is accomplished by increasing or decreasing the flow through the valve in response to a signal from a pressure, flow, or temperature controller. The primary requirement of a flow-control valve is to predictably regulate the flow with respect to its open position and impart the required pressure drop without sustaining damage. Specially designed globe, needle, butterfly, ball, plug, and dia- phragm valves are capable of satisfying these requirements in varying degrees. The manufacturer’s literature should be consulted for the limitations placed on a particular valve. Backflow Prevention Valves are generally used for the prevention of backflow. The valves are self- actuating and the valve disc is kept open by the forward flow of fluid. The valve disc is quickly closed by reverse flow. In certain applications, pneumatic actuators may be used to assist in the rapid closure of the valves on reversal of flow. Pressure-Relief Devices Pressure-relief devices are used to pro- tect piping and equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design pressures. Generally, the seating of relief valves is accomplished by a com- pressed spring, which exerts a force on the valve disc, pressing it against the valve seat. When the force exerted by the fluid on the valve disc exceeds the spring force, the valve automatically opens to release the excess pressure. Other designs incorporate a pilot valve, which uses system pressure to control the movement of the disc. Another type FIGURE A10.4 The rupture disc, a type of of pressure-relieving device, although relief device. not a valve, is a rupture disc. See Fig. A10.4. The rupture disc is designed to burst open at a predetermined pressure. A rupture disc cannot be reseated and, therefore, must be replaced once it has performed its relieving function. Rupture discs have the advantage of being leak tight up to the rupture pressure and of being capable of relieving large rates of flow. The set pressure of rupture discs cannot be adjusted.

## APPENDIX B – EXTRA INFORMATION

The definitions are intended as a guide for the language used in the Essential Skills Inventories.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

ABE Adult Basic Education Apprentice For the purpose of this Guide, apprentice is an inclusive term that refers to anyone working in a trade except those already certified. Authentic workplace documents

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Actual documents obtained from an employer that may be used as teaching tools. An example document is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Block Release Training A period of in-school training for apprentices. It may also be referred to as Period Training or a Level. Dynamic (interactive) Assessment A flexible, holistic, context-sensitive approach used to evaluate learning. Essential Skills The set of nine skills defined by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada as being common to all occupations. The skills are: reading text (technical language), document use, numeracy (math), oral communication, writing, computer use, thinking skills, continuous learning and working with others. Essential Skills Profile A document that describes how each Essential Skill is used by an occupational group. GED General Education Diploma; a Grade 12 equivalency for adults. Grade 12 A diploma issued by a provincial or territorial government that recognizes completion of High School. It is a challenge to use this as a common credential, since there are several different Grade 12 diplomas.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Intervention For the purpose of this Guide, intervention refers to a trade- specific Essential Skills program delivered to either a group or an individual. Journeyperson A person who holds a Certificate of Qualification in a designated trade. A certified journeyperson is allowed to train and mentor apprentices. Red Seal A seal of endorsement applied to a Certification of Qualification for a trade. It allows for mobility among provinces and territories. A certified journeyperson is allowed to train and mentor apprentices. Trade Essentials A three-year research project to develop Essential Skills and Prior Learning assessments and curricula specific to 13 trades and to pilot the materials with six of those trades. The 13 trades included in this project were: Automotive Service Technician, Carpenter, Cabinetmaker, Cook, Construction Electrician, Industrial Electrician, Machinist, Metal Fabricator, Oil Burner Mechanic, Plumber, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic, Steamfitter/Pipefitter and Welder. Materials were piloted with Carpenters, Steamfitter/Pipefitters, Welders, Automotive Service Technicians, Plumbers and Cooks.

1 SECTION 1 1.1 Introduction

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Essential Skills Inventories were developed during a three-year Trade Essentials project whose mandate was to develop Essential Skills assessments and curricula for 13 trades. These materials provide an opportunity for tradespeople to identify and update the Essential Skills required for their respective trades as an important step towards successful trade certification. The Essential Skills Inventory is a tool used to identify both strengths and weaknesses in trade-specific Essential Skills profiles. 2 SECTION 2 2.1 Interactive Assessment

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Adult learners have different needs than “traditional” students so strategies must be developed to engage, motivate and build their confidence.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Essential Skills Inventories use an innovative, interactive (dynamic) approach to assessment that is both client- centred and asset-based. An asset-based approach compares the apprentices’ present Essential Skills to the skills needed for their trade, connecting what they already know with what they need to learn.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Inventory is a process more than a product and requires skilled and experienced assessors to establish an atmosphere where apprentices are comfortable enough to think about and explore their learning in an Essential Skills context. Assessors need the “inner technology” to be sensitive to the needs of the apprentice and to know when to stop an Essential Skills Inventory if the apprentice is struggling. The interactive assessment explores not only what the apprentice knows and can do, but also, gives an awareness of how the apprentice learns.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

This type of assessment can be used in a pre- and post- format but cannot be referred to normative tables for interpretation. It is designed as a starting point for instruction in Essential Skills for the trades.

7265 The Essential Skills Inventories include: � reading text � document use � numeracy � oral communication � computer use � writing

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

By using the trade-specific Essential Skills Inventory you can help an apprentice identify those skills to be updated by building upon the skills he/she already has. This process provides immediate, individual feedback to the learner. This is an assessment used for learning, not of learning.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Motivation is fundamental to change and this process helps an apprentice become motivated, engaged and confident in learning. Confidence can never be disconnected from skills. However, the apprentice does need to have a readiness, willingness and an ability to learn in order to be successful. In addition, many adults fear returning to a structured learning environment after a lengthy absence. It is very difficult to discover the learning needs of adults without the creation of a “safe environment”. This is even more evident with those who have the greatest learning needs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Why do apprentices need to go through this process?

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

At present, there is neither a process nor a place for those who are already working in a trade to update their trade- related Essential Skills other than completing Block training. Awareness of the trade-specific Essential Skills and the knowledge of the scope of a trade is a starting point on the path to certification. Individual assessments (inventories) followed by appropriate interventions (supports) provide the opportunity for eventual certification in the trade. The objective of this process is to help apprentices be successful in passing certification exams whether they be Block or Interprovincial Red Seal exams.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

2.2 Adult Education

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It is very important to be mindful of both the principles of Adult Education and the characteristics of adult learners.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

2.2.1 Principles of Adult Education 1

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Adults must want to learn. Trade Essentials clients have stated the primary reason for participating in an Essential Skills program and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

1 Adapted from www.literacy.ca, Movement for Canadian Literacy, Principles of Adult Education

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

We need assessment and training so the workforce has the required Essential Skills to adapt to changing demands.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

obtaining certification was personal satisfaction, not job mobility or an increase in pay.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Adults will learn only what they believe they need to learn. They have a practical approach to learning as they need to know how this learning affects them now.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Adults learn by doing. Ninety-eight percent of the apprentices in the Trade Essentials Project identified their preferred learning style as kinesthetic.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Adult learning focuses on problems and the problems must be realistic. The Essential Skills Inventories use trade-specific materials and focus on the apprentice’s ability to solve problems since that is the nature of their jobs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Experience affects adult learning. All apprentices bring a varied background of acquired skills and knowledge together with an attitude about learning.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Adults learn best in an informal situation. Many of the apprentices indicated they appreciate the opportunity to learn with their peers at a time convenient to them (evenings, Saturdays) and in a setting where they are comfortable sharing their knowledge with others. For the first time, there is a place dedicated to apprentices where they can access the information and the support they need.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Adults want guidance. While experienced in their individual trades, apprentices may need help to create a learning plan to meet their objective.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

2.2.2 Characteristics of Adult Learners 2

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Adult students are mature people and prefer to be treated as such. Being “lectured at” can cause resentment and frustration. Apprentices are usually kinesthetic learners and need to be active when

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

2 Adapted from www.assetproject.info. Learner Centred Methodologies, Wynne, R.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

learning. They also learn from each other in a classroom setting.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Adults are goal/relevancy–oriented. Adults need to know why they are learning because their needs are concrete and immediate. They will be more interested in theory if it links to practical application. • Adults may have insufficient confidence. A number of apprentices may have had prior experiences within the education system that have led to feelings of inadequacy, fear of study and failure. Many apprentices have been out of a formal learning situation for 20 years or more. Returning to a classroom environment can be daunting and challenging. • Adults are often tired when they come to class as they are juggling work, family and other responsibilities. Most apprentices are working full time and are attending a program in the evenings and on occasional Saturdays. Many drive considerable distances, as well as driving in winter conditions.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Adults learn best when they are ready to learn and when they have identified their own learning needs as opposed to being controlled by someone else. They want to choose options based on their own needs. Providing the apprentices with a chance to self- assess and identify their strengths and weaknesses is an important first step.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Adults learn at different rates and in various ways according to their learning styles, educational levels, experiences and relationships. The first section of the ESI is a Learning Styles Inventory. Most apprentices have never identified their own learning styles and this is often an “aha” moment for them. Being able to use this information for learning and studying techniques is invaluable to them.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Adults have accumulated life/work experiences. They tend to favour learning that draws on their prior skills and knowledge. The Essential Skills Inventory is an assessment for learning, providing an opportunity for each apprentice to realize what he/she already knows and to move forward from that base. The Essential Skills Inventory identifies skills in need of updating using in-context materials and a guided self-

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

assessment. The skills may have been learned in a formal setting or on the job.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

3 SECTION 3 3.1 The Essential Skills Inventory

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Conducted in a manner that engages the apprentice and helps build confidence, the completed Inventory provides a picture of the apprentice’s learning needs while recognizing the skills that have already been acquired. The Inventory is as much a process as a product. The time required to complete an Inventory will vary depending on the apprentice but should be completed in one and a half to two hours. Six of the nine Essential Skills are assessed in these Inventories and are in this order: reading text (technical language), document use, numeracy, oral communication, computer use and writing. The Inventory is divided into sections and the section questions are ordered from simple to complex. 3.1.1 Process

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Sit beside, not across from, the apprentice as a table or desk impedes good communication and can be interpreted as one person being in a position of authority over another. If a round table is available, use it. Apprentices are not often asked to self assess, but will do so willingly if they are comfortable with the assessor and understand the process.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

3.1.2 Essential Skills Profiles

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The concept of Essential Skills and Essential Skills Profiles will likely be new to the apprentice. At the beginning of the interview therefore, introduce the trade-specific Essential Skills Profile. Give the apprentice a hard copy of the profile to take away with him/her. Encourage a thorough review of the profile as well as the Essential Skills website (www.hrsdc.gc.ca/essentialskills) for additional information.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

When introducing the profile, include these points: � The profiles are Canadian. They were developed by interviewing fellow tradespersons, supervisors, managers and researchers in workplaces across the country.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Knowledge is knowing … or knowing where to find out.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

- Alvin Toffler

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Over 350 occupational profiles are available on the website with development ongoing for additional profiles. � Nine skills are identified as core skills common to all occupations. (The Trade Essentials Project developed learning materials for six of the nine Essential Skills).

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� The Essential Skills are used in different ways and at different degrees of complexity, depending on the occupation. � The complexity levels have nothing to do with Grade levels; they refer to the degree of difficulty of tasks completed at work. A scale of 1-5 is used for complexity levels and, even though there is a range in complexity levels, one must be able to complete tasks at the most complex level. It is important to keep this discussion brief and framed in a positive manner. Adults do not want to spend time re- learning what they already know so it is helpful to give examples of the advantages of using the profile. Suggestions are: a) a plumbing apprentice may not ever need to know how to solve quadratic equations but will need to be very good at measurement and calculations for such uses as determining grade, elevation and slope, b) an apprentice may not have to read an entire operating manual but will need to find and use specific pieces of information from the manual, c) an apprentice will have to be very accurate when completing an incident or an accident report but will not be required to write an essay. The writing, in this instance, does not have to be long or complicated but it does need to be accurate and precise. It is important to make the connections between what they have learned in a more “academic” setting and how to apply those skills in a work setting.

3.1.3 Preparation

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Print the apprentice’s copy of the ES Inventory on light- coloured paper, preferably beige, as it reflects less light than white paper so is easier to read; the black print actually is clearer on a pastel background. The font used is Verdana, a sans serif font, 11 point, which is slightly easier to read than a serif font; 11 point is also easier to read than a smaller font. Gather the supplies you need prior to beginning the Essential Skills Inventory:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� scientific calculator

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� pencils and an eraser

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� skills summary form

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� ESI printed on coloured paper

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The rationale for this formatting is that there is a need to provide equal opportunity for all apprentices without compromising standards. No two learners (apprentices) are the same. There is a possibility that an apprentice could have a learning disability and unless the apprentice has disclosed that information or provided documentation, you do not know who is at risk. Using standard formatting does not give an advantage to anyone.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Before you begin the actual Inventory, it is very important to explain to the apprentice that you will complete the Skills Summary Form as the assessment proceeds and you will give him/her a copy at the end of the interview. This avoids any discomfort that would be caused if the apprentice does not know why you are recording information during the Inventory. It is important to provide immediate feedback from the Inventory so the apprentice has a picture of the Essential Skills he/she needs to update. This also helps to mitigate anxiety prior to beginning an intervention.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Before you begin an Inventory, be sure to have these items:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Two copies of the trade-specific Essential Skills Profile (one for the apprentice and one for you). � Appropriate forms. You will need copies of the Intake Form and the Skills Summary Form (find samples in Appendix A).

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� A copy of the Essential Skills Inventory printed on pastel-coloured paper, preferably beige or buff. You may want to work from a single copy with the apprentice or have a separate copy for yourself. Do whatever is comfortable for you and the apprentice. � A copy of the Answer Key. � A pencil and an eraser. � A basic scientific calculator.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Although an apprentice may use a programmable or trade- specific calculator on the worksite, these types of calculators cannot be used when writing a Block or an Interprovincial exam. However, the prudent use of a basic scientific calculator should be encouraged while completing the Essential Skills Inventory. (One suggestion is the Casio FX- 260 Solar.) A calculator is also a time saver on the job which results in increased efficiency and cost savings. Therefore the apprentice needs to be very familiar with its use. For anyone with a learning disability, the calculator can be a particularly helpful tool. The use of a calculator does

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

not, however, preclude the apprentice’s ability to understand mathematical concepts and to estimate reasonable answers. 3.1.4 Sections of the Inventory 3.1.4.1 Learning Styles

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Briefly explain the concept of learning styles (refer to Appendix B for more information). Then ask the apprentice to read each of the statements in the Inventory relatively quickly. Tell him/her to check any statements that are true personally, all or most of the time. It is best for the apprentice to go with a first reaction to the statement rather than to spend too much time thinking about it. If a statement does not apply, it is to be left blank. If there are three or more checks in one category, that indicates a preferred learning style. A pattern will emerge from the answers; most apprentices will have more than one learning style.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Follow the same instructions for the section on learning in a group or learning alone. This is important information for the apprentice and for the instructor.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

3.1.4.2 Technical Language (Reading text)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

This section begins with lists of words that are contextualized to the trade and have been taken from either the Essential Skills Profile (ESP) or the National Occupational Analysis (NOA) glossary. The lists are arranged in order from simple to complex, each list containing ten words.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Ask the apprentice to choose a list he/she would be comfortable reading aloud. As long as the apprentice has seven out of ten words correct in any list, ask him/her to continue reading aloud as far as possible with the lists. Some apprentices will begin reading at a lower level and continue to the end of list four; others will read list four on the first try. It is important for the apprentice to begin reading at a point of comfort and to proceed from there. If an apprentice struggles with the first list, stop there. Use the list to indicate a beginning point for the technical reading excerpts. For example, if an apprentice reads six out of ten words (less than seven) in list three, refer to section two in the reading. A crucial aspect of the technical reading is to know when to stop if the apprentice is struggling The Essential Skills Inventory provides a wealth of information about the apprentices and their learning.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

with a skill. This is one of the most important skills for you to have as an assessor, that is, to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of each apprentice.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Before using the reading excerpts, ask each apprentice to read the list of pseudowords (nonsense words). Explain the reason for using this list; that decoding words is an important reading skill for comprehension, speed and fluency. If the apprentice struggles with this list and cannot read most of the words, this is a warning that the apprentice may have reading difficulties.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The reading excerpts consist of trade-related materials. A readability index has been completed on each passage as a guide for the difficulty of the reading. Give the apprentice the appropriate reading. Ask him/her to read the questions first, then find the answers to the questions from the excerpt. Explain that the answers to certain questions are not direct matches of information but require “reading between the lines” to find the answer. The questions have been intentionally placed at the beginning of the reading to help the apprentice become a “directed” reader.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Record the section(s) with which the apprentice experiences difficulty (if any). While the reading is not timed, you will want to record if an apprentice takes an exceptionally long

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

time to answer the questions. All apprentices need to be able to read and understand at a post–secondary level (level 3) if they are to be able to confidently use materials at work and to keep pace with workplace changes.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

If the apprentice does not need to update reading skills, complete the Skills Summary Form with “No updating required”. If the apprentice has difficulty answering any questions in a particular section, record the Section Number on the Skills Summary Form. 3.1.4.3 Document Use

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The document use sections contain information that is presented in a format other than text. There may be charts, graphs, tables, schematics and/or blueprints that are trade- related. There is always a question taken from the National Occupational Analysis (NOA), in the form of a pie chart that explains the construction of the Interprovincial (Red Seal) exam and the percentage of questions on each topic (block) for the particular trade. This question not only indicates if

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

the apprentice can find and use information from a pie chart but also gives you, the assessor, the opportunity to give a brief explanation of the exam format and the scope of the specific trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Record the Section and the type of document with which an apprentice experiences difficulty. If there is no apparent difficulty, record “No updating required”. 3.1.4.4 Numeracy

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The numeracy sections are arranged from simple to complex and are based on the Math Skills Summary identified in the Essential Skills Profile for each trade. Not all skills are included for the sake of brevity of the Inventory but enough are included to give an instructor a picture of the skills of the apprentices. There is a Math Legend included in each Inventory that identifies the math concept illustrated by each question. Refer to this as you proceed through the Inventory and record the skills needing updates on the Skills Summary Sheet.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Section 1 (S-1) begins with using whole numbers. It is important to have a place for the apprentice to begin where he/she is comfortable and confident and then proceed to more difficult concepts. The apprentice will likely choose to skip the work with whole numbers. An apprentice does not have to write the answers to all the questions as this is often far too time-consuming. You can decide to ask the apprentice how to find the answer. The process is as important as the product. Stop Inventory if the apprentice is struggling. The numeracy sections take the most amount of time when completing an Inventory.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Record the section number and the concepts the apprentice needs to update. This information will be required by both the apprentice and the instructor or tutor; it will also be used for a post-inventory after instruction or self-study has occurred. If your apprentice can answer all the questions, record “No updating required”. 3.1.4.5 Oral Communication

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

There are two parts to the Oral Communication section of the Essential Skills Inventory. The Speaking Skills Rating Scale is to be completed by you, the assessor; the other is a self-assessment completed by the apprentice. After having

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

spent one and a half to two hours with the apprentice, you will be able to complete most sections of the scale. If not, document a particular skill as “not assessed” or “not applicable”. The remaining questions are taken directly from the Essential Skills Profile for the trade. The questions (tasks) are arranged in order from simple to complex. The self-assessment scale mirrors the stages of learning or skill building, that is, “needs help”, “can do alone” and “can help an apprentice”. This is an opportune time to mention the fact that it is a responsibility of being a journeyperson to mentor other apprentices.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

If the journeyperson indicates he/she cannot help an apprentice, record that updating is required. 3.1.4.6 Computer Use

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The questions in the Computer Use section may reflect the information in the trade-specific Essential Skills Profile or may go beyond that profile. In a knowledge-based economy, it is realistic to expect a certain level of computer literacy regardless of the trade in which one is employed. The Computer Use questions reflect the basic skills required. Changes in technology will continue to occur rapidly so it is critical to have at least a basic knowledge of computer use.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Record the skills to be updated. If there are no needs identified, record “No updating required”.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

3.1.4.7 Writing

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The first questions in the writing section are examples taken directly from the Essential Skills profile and range in difficulty from simple to complex. The scale used reflects the stages of learning: “needs help”, “can do alone”, and “can help an apprentice”. One additional question pertains to the preparation of a resumé, a skill required by all tradespersons.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The last question is a writing sample and is common to all the Inventories. The writing sample provides an opportunity for you to observe if the apprentice is able to:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o use cursive writing (as compared to printing) o write legibly o complete the activity with ease or struggle to write a sentence or two

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o put thoughts on paper in a logical order o use punctuation correctly o spell correctly o use correct grammar

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Record on the Skills Summary Form areas in need of updating, or use “No updating required”.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

4 SECTION 4 4.1 Essential Skills Inventory Records

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

You will have completed the Skills Summary form by the end of the Inventory. Using this process as a means of learning the apprentice’s strengths and weaknesses provides an opportunity to give each apprentice immediate, individual and confidential feedback about his/her Essential Skills needs. Inform the apprentice that a copy will go to an instructor or a tutor if an Essential Skills intervention is planned. Both the apprentice and the instructor are then cognizant of the Essential Skills needs of each apprentice.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The information from the Skills Summary can be summarized in graph form (bar graph recommended) individually, or as a group dependent on specific needs. It is also helpful for an instructor to have an accompanying narrative.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

5 SECTION 5 5.1 Essential Skills Post-Inventory 5.1.1 Post-Inventory Directions

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The post-inventory will be different for each apprentice dependent upon his/her learning needs as identified in the original ES Inventory. Only the skills that were to be updated are used to create the post-inventory. There is a scale used to indicate an apprentice’s improvement or mastery of the skills. This post-inventory can be used at a time determined either by the instructor or after a specific number of intervention hours.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The administrative directions for the post-inventory are that it is to be given under standard test conditions, that is, each Education is what remains after one has forgotten what has been learned at school.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

apprentice is to complete the inventory independently and without assistance. The time required for each post- inventory will vary, but each apprentice must be allowed the time required for completion.

## ESSENTIAL SKILLS INVENTORY POST INVENTORY

Essential Skills Post Inventories

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The results of the Essential Skills Inventories, completed by each of your apprentices prior to the beginning of your program, indicated the Essential Skills in need of updating for each apprentice.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

To track each apprentice’s progress, it is now time to complete a post- inventory of those same skills.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Please administer the Post-Inventory as a “test”, that is, each apprentice is to complete the Inventory without any help. Ask each apprentice to complete only the questions that are marked. The time required will vary for each apprentice as each post- inventory is different; therefore please give each apprentice the time needed to complete the inventory. Upon completion, return the Inventories to Trade Essentials (with your program coordinator). The results will be returned to you to share with your apprentices. This will be one indication of each apprentice’s readiness to challenge an exam whether it be the IP Red Seal exam or block exam.

## ESSENTIAL SKILLS INVENTORY

The following information is provided as supplemental information for you the interviewer. Because the Essential Skills initial interview is a dynamic assessment involving your input and possible responses to the apprentice, you may need/want additional reference material on both Learning Styles and the Essential Skills required for the various trades.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning style refers to the way an individual processes information, that is, the way a person learns best. Most people tend to use one sense more than the other. However, a number of people may learn equally well regardless of how information is presented to them. Knowing your learning style is an important key to improving success in a classroom and on exams.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It is important to know how one learns, not just what one needs to learn. Completion of the Learning Styles section at the beginning of the Essential Skills Inventory will help the apprentice discover his/her learning style. This can often be an “Aha” moment for the apprentice as s/he may not have had access to this information. The learner can then reflect on, gather, or be provided with information about the study and learning techniques suited to his/her individual learning style. This knowledge should contribute to an improvement in the quality and speed of learning.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

There are basically three learning styles preferences: auditory (hearing), visual (seeing), and kinesthetic (doing, experiencing).

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Visual learners are those who learn best by seeing things. A visual learner may display these characteristics:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� good at spelling but may forget names � needs quiet time to study � needs time to think before understanding a lecture � understands/likes charts � good with sign language

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Auditory learners are those who learn best by hearing things. An auditory learner may display these characteristics:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� not afraid to speak in a group/class � likes to read aloud to him/herself � likes oral reports � good at explaining � remembers names � enjoys music � good at grammar and foreign languages � may read slowly � follows spoken directions well � good in study groups � finds it difficult to stay quiet for long periods

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## ESSENTIAL SKILLS INVENTORY

Kinesthetic learners are those who learn by experiencing /doing things. A kinesthetic learner is one who:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� can’t sit still for long � may be good at sports � may not have great handwriting � likes role playing � studies with music playing � takes breaks when studying � fidgets during lectures

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

(Adapted from http://homework tips.about.com)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Suggested strategies for studying /learning are:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Auditory Visual Kinesthetic Listen to instructions and information orally Watch for key words to summarize points Ask questions and participate in discussions whenever possible Sit towards the front of the room Complete readings before class Do something physical before sitting down to study Repeat information silently to yourself Use visuals like symbols and color in notes Break reading tasks into small chunks Work in quiet areas Write down what you hear Highlight, underline or take notes Tape important information Ask for other visual information Take regular brief breaks to move around Use rhymes or jingles to summarize important points Try to remember important terminology by looking for parts of words already known Break reading into chunks and write brief summaries Create verbal descriptions Color code notes

Each different ratio has its own formula. These are shown below.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The ratio of opposite = sine or sin

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The ratio of adjacent = cosine or cos

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The ratio of opposite = tangent or tan

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

NOTE The acronyms for the three ratios are: � Sine opposite hypotenuse – SOH � Cosine adjacent hypotenuse – CAH � Tangent opposite adjacent - TAS These acronyms are extremely helpful as they can be used to write out the three different formulas and aid in solving trigonometry questions. These three formulas can be changed into three formula triangles and then it is a matter of substituting them into the formula. The three formula triangles are shown in Figure 9.

From the article below, answer the following questions.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

1. List two problems that can be caused by a leaking joint on a sewer or drain installed underground.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

a) ________________________________________

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

b) ________________________________________

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Why do we not just replace clogged sewer lines?

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Leaked and Blocked Pipes

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

A leaking joint on a sewer or drain installed below the surface of the soil would allow sewage to enter the subsoil. This could contaminate the drinking water. A leaky joint of this kind might also allow soil to enter the drain and cause stoppage of the drain line. Leaky underground pipe joints in yard areas allow the entrance of fine, fibrous tree roots.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Once these roots have entered the pipe, they spread quickly. They can fill the entire inside of the pipe and block it. A drain blocked with tree roots usually requires mechanical cleaning of the drain line. Sometimes only digging up the drain and replacing it with a new drain can open the pipe.

## 1. List the 3 conditions that control the amount of flow in piping.

____________________ ____________________ ____________________

## 2. When can you use the formula D2 ÷ d2 for finding the ratio of pipe capacities?

__ ______________________________________

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Ratio of Pipe Capacities

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The information given here is intended to help the plumber in case a flow problem occurs. However, most pipe is sized by the architect or the engineer.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Pressure, friction, and cross-sectional area of the pipes control the amount of flow in piping. Water pressure is beyond the control of the plumber in most installations. Friction is somewhat reduced by proper design of a piping system to run as directly as possible. The material used may also affect friction. Copper tubing and PVC pipe have smoother walls than steel or wrought iron pipe. The smoother surface has less frictional resistance.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The plumber can install a larger pipe size to provide adequate pipe flow to each faucet. Only in a fire sprinkler system must all outlets have full flow at the same time. In plumbing a percent of full use is expected. The architect sizes pipe for the expected use, using small size pipe whenever possible for the sake of economy.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

There are two ways of computing the ratio of pipe capacities. The first, D2 ÷ d2, is a simplification of AREA ÷ area and makes no allowance for friction. This method is simple to use and gives a practical answer when the large diameter in not more than twice the small diameter. Also, pipe lengths should be short, which means 10 feet or less for pipe sizes 1” and smaller and up to 20 feet for larger sizes of pipe. A more accurate comparison is obtained by which does allow for friction. Friction is greater in smaller pipes because a greater percentage of the total water drags against the pipe wall.

## 2. List three ways you could use computers in your trade.

Computers Give Orders

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It is safe to say that all trades use computers for some part of their work. Many business functions are performed by computers including scheduling, record keeping, accounting, inventory management, communications with suppliers and customers, diagrams, and blueprints, and project management.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

One of the important benefits of computers is real time inventory management. When an item is taken out of an inventory, a computer program can immediately update all records based on that inventory, a manager can have a computer alert him when the supply is down to 500 fittings. The next step, already happening in some companies, is for the computer to automatically generate an order for more parts when the supply reaches a pre-set limit.

## 1. To calculate the heat loss from buildings, which math formulas would you need to know?

__ ___________________

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

2. To calculate the area of the ceiling shown in the figure below, state the number and the types of shapes to be used.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

_______________________________________________

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Geometry has a large absolutely essential role to play in all of the construction trades. The ability to visualize problems in geometric shapes and forms is vital in decision making. Piping length calculations always come down to one or another common plane figure: a square, a rectangle, a triangle, a circle, or even a simple line. Once a problem has been resolved to one or more of these, a corresponding formula may be easily applied and the solution is close at hand.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The problem may require the application of a number of geometric shapes before the solution can be deduced. When calculating heat loss from buildings, the areas and volumes of walls and rooms are often found by breaking the overall shape into geometric parts and then adding together the volumes of the individual parts. The same breakdowns must be made when calculating the volumes of tanks and excavations.

Learning Styles

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

After the apprentice has completed the learning styles checklist, note the sections that contain three or more checkmarks. Those sections indicate the preferred learning style of that apprentice. The majority of apprentices will show preference for more than one learning style.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning Environment

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Group and individual learning environments - If an apprentice indicates a strong preference for one environment over another, an instructor needs to be aware of the implications this has for a teaching environment.

## TECHNICAL LANGUAGE

Have the apprentice begin reading aloud a list with which he/she is comfortable. If an apprentice has difficulty with more than three words in list one, stop the Inventory. If the apprentice has 7/10 words correct in any list, move up to the next list. The lists have been written in a simple to more complex order and are words contextualized to each trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The apprentice should not have major difficulty with the pronunciation of these pseudo words. The reason for inclusion of this list is that it tells the assessor if the apprentice has major difficulties with phonics which can affect learning to read technical language at the required level.

## Appendix B – Essentials Skills for All Apprentices

The Trade Essentials curriculum materials currently uses six of these Essential Skills: Reading, Document Use, Numeracy, Oral Communication, Writing and Computer Use

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## 1. Introduction

The Curriculum Guidebook is designed to provide support and practical advice to instructors who are delivering Essential Skills training, as well as to those who wish to incorporate Essential Skills into technical training. Currently, this Guidebook has been prepared for thirteen trades; however, the template can be adapted for use in any trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The thirteen trades include:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Automotive Service Technician � Cabinetmaker � Carpenter � Cook � Construction Electrician � Industrial Electrician � Machinist � Metal Fabricator � Oil Burner Mechanic � Plumber � Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic � Steamfitter-Pipefitter � Welder

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## 2. Why Essential Skills?

Essential Skills are needed for work, learning and life. They provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their jobs and adapt to workplace change.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Through extensive research, the Government of Canada and other national and international agencies have identified and validated nine essential skills. These skills are used in every occupation and throughout daily life in different ways.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Reading Text � Document Use � Numeracy � Oral Communication � Writing � Computer Use � Thinking Skills � Working with Others � Continuous Learning

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

For more information on Essential Skills, visit the website at www.hrsdc.gc.ca/essentialskills

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Although the term ‘Essential Skills’ has been around for a number of years, there is growing recognition of the link between Essential Skills and success in the trades. Essential Skills are used in every occupation and more specifically, in every trade, but they are used in different ways and at varying degrees of difficulty.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

These skills are not technical skills though they may be taught using materials or examples from a particular trade. Rather, they are the foundational skills that exist in all occupations. The six Essential skills outlined above were used in the creation of materials for the Trade Essentials project.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Curriculum Frameworks identify the Essential Skills requirements for thirteen trades and provide concrete examples of how these skills are utilized in each trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Essential Skill requirements are based primarily on HRSDC’s Essential Skills profiles www.hrsdc.gc.ca/essentialskills and the National Occupational Analyses. (http://www.red-seal.ca/tr.1d.2n.4adeta.3l@-eng.jsp?tid=230 They have been reviewed and validated by certified tradespeople and supplemented by additional research gathered from the Trade Essentials project.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

3. Instructor Requirements To be effective, curriculum development and delivery must be guided by the principles of adult education. Learners in the Essential Skills programs will have a wide variety of backgrounds, work experience, education and work-related credentials. Many of these learners will be employed in full time positions with additional responsibilities outside of work. It is critical for the instructor to understand the unique requirements of adult learners and be prepared with challenging, relevant and engaging learning activities. • Instructors must have knowledge and experience in the area of adult education. • Instructors should have experience in working in a multi-level classroom environment. • Instructors must be familiar with Essential Skills, how Essential Skills are used in the trades, and with the trade itself. Red Seal certification is encouraged. • Instructors must be able to provide the link between Essential Skills and the trade and will provide a trade context from their own experience and expertise. In some instances a team approach with both an Essential Skills and a trades instructor may be preferable. • It is important that those who presently provide technical training also receive training to increase their understanding of Essential Skills.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## 4. Curriculum Development

The curriculum frameworks are derived from an outcomes-based approach to learning focusing on the outcome of the intervention or course of study-what the learner will be able to do or will know at the end of the intervention. They have been developed to

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

support individual learning needs in each of the six Essential Skills and are the generic Essential Skills Maps for all thirteen trades included in the Trade Essentials project.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The following describes the structure and components of the curriculum frameworks developed for apprentices at the Trade Essentials Centre.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning Category

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

A Learning Category (as defined by Trade Essentials) is a general curriculum outcome and is one of the six Essential Skills identified for development in the Trade Essentials project: Reading Text, Document Use, Numeracy, Oral Communication, Computer Use and Writing. It appears in the top band across each of the six frameworks as shown in the example below.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Note: Reading Text will be referred to as Technical Reading in all frameworks

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning Category

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning Outcome

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

A Learning Outcome is a specific curriculum outcome and describes what a learner should know or be able to do as the result of a course of study. Trade Essentials has identified one Learning Outcome for each Learning Category. The learning outcome statement appears below the Learning Category. For example, the learning outcome in the Trade Essentials Technical Reading Framework is:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learners will locate, recall, understand and interpret information in written text

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning Objective

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning objectives are the standards or benchmarks that identify what learners will know or will be able to do as the result of the completion of a number of related competencies in a particular “band”. In the example below, the objective for the band is: TR1 – Use Terminology of the Trade (Burgundy Box).

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learning Objective

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## TECHNICAL READING FRAMEWORK

TR1 Use Terminology of the Trade

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

While an objective describes ‘what’ we expect learners to achieve, competencies identify ‘how’ learners can achieve that objective. Competencies are specific activities used to measure whether or not learners have mastered the objective. In Table 1 below, the learner must master competencies 2.1 and 2.2 (taupe boxes) to demonstrate mastery of the objective. Where objectives demonstrate the end result, competencies are a means to that end. Competencies provide a framework for selecting instructional materials and techniques and provide a basis for determining when instruction has been successful.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

2.2 Implement strategies to improve understanding and recall of written information

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The flow chart provides a visual representation of the framework

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## 5. Curriculum Resources

Three types of resources are identified in the curriculum guidelines: non-contextualized, contextualized, and technical. These resources have been listed throughout the guidelines. It is not intended that instructors use all of the resources outlined but, instead, choose material and deliver its content as it best suits individual learner needs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Non-contextualized resources are not related to any trade or occupation. These resources may be used to review the competencies in a stand-alone manner before transferring the skill to trade-related materials. They can be useful when learners have identified literacy challenges or when basic strategies need to be understood before applying them to higher order learning.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Contextualized resources provide Essential Skills applications in the context of a specific trade or occupation and are generally written at a more basic level than technical materials. They are particularly useful when learners have identified Essential Skills gaps but can only identify relevance/motivation to the task if it is related to their specific trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Technical resources are trades training materials from which Essential Skills can be extracted. These resources are written at a higher reading level than non-contextualized and contextualized resources and can often be found in block release training and college trade programs. Generally, learners who would benefit from these materials have few Essential Skills gaps in their learning.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## 6. Preparation and Delivery

Instructors will be provided with a complete copy of the Essential Skills Frameworks associated with the trades/courses for which they are responsible. Instructors will use essential skills assessment information to build a learning session for one client or a group of clients.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The instructor will be required to prepare lesson plans as a tool to organize and plan the delivery of training. A lesson plan template in included in Appendix A. A brief description of each section of the lesson plan is included in the attached template to serve as a guide. The instructor may add additional notes and documents as required. Completed lesson plans should be kept on file to provide continuity in subsequent sessions.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It is important to note that, even though objectives and competencies progress from least to most difficult, instruction need not move in a linear fashion. In recognition of their prior knowledge, learners may begin their study at any objective in the curriculum frameworks, may not require instruction in all of the competencies in each band, and/or may simultaneously complete competencies in all six Essential Skill curriculum frameworks.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Learners who have extensive Essential Skills gaps may require that the curriculum framework be followed using a linear approach beginning with the least complex objectives.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The curriculum frameworks are applicable to all thirteen trades identified for the project. For instance, though “Using Documents” is identified as important to both cooks and carpenters; however, the way documents are used in the trade is what makes them relevant to that specific trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The exception is “Numeracy” where not all objectives listed are required in all thirteen trades. For example, a cook may not be required to master all of the learning objectives outlined in the framework whereas a machinist requires mastery of all. Appendix B includes a checklist of the skills required for each particular trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The guidelines define objectives and competencies and identify matching resources. The instructor can then use these resources to develop lesson plans that best suit the needs of their particular audience.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Though frameworks are written in academic language (at an academic level), the intent is that the objectives and competencies be taught using trade specific examples. Curriculum frameworks may be delivered one-on-one or in a group learning environment.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

6.1 Approaches to Delivery

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The delivery approach can be stand alone or cross curricular, depending on the needs of the client or client group.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

A stand alone approach involves using any one of the curriculum frameworks in its entirety as a stand alone course. For example, carpenters who have been away from the classroom for a long time may benefit from a review of the complete Numeracy framework and focus solely on that Essential Skill.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Others, including those who have achieved journey person status, may require a Computer Course or a course in Oral Communication to improve their skills in dealing with customers or in mentoring new apprentices.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It is assumed that in many classroom situations instructors will use a cross-curricular approach to develop a number of skills at the same time.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

All students will benefit from instruction in how to understand and retain information from trade-related materials. For example, using the codebook for locating information can address both technical reading and document use. An activity which requires the learner to complete an invoice may provide the opportunity to incorporate technical reading, writing, document use and numeracy in one exercise.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It is intended that Essential Skills can be embedded in the curriculum wherever possible and that instruction in many of the skill areas will not be time-tabled as such. It has

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

been proven that a learning environment that provides opportunity for discussion and interaction among learners will improve comprehension and long-term memory.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## 7. Measuring Learning: Instructor’s Role in Evaluation

There are a number of informal methods that could be used periodically by the instructor to ensure progress. It is important to note that measurement is not based on a “Pass- Fail;” it is understood that the learner sees the value in improving their skill level and will continue to develop their skills until they are comfortable and confident in performing the required tasks.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Informal Evaluation Methods:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Provide opportunities and simple recording forms for the learner to assess their progress. • Review individual assessments on a regular basis against the curricula framework • Pay particular attention to those identified as potential “early leavers” to ensure they are moving forward as anticipated. • Pay attention to those who experience unanticipated difficulties in the group environment. • Document observations of performance in class • Develop a rubrics for a particular objective that can be shared with students Formal Evaluation:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• Where a more formal evaluation approach is desired, the instructors or learners could design and complete a structured checklist (see sample checklist in Appendices). Mastery of skills at the highest level using the application to the trade would demonstrate that the learner meets trade requirements.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## 8. Intervention Timeframe

The Trade Essentials interventions have been developed for individualized learning; therefore, no set time period has been determined for the delivery of the material. Learners’ prior knowledge and time necessary to learn or relearn skills should determine the length of time spent in the intervention. For that purpose, a continuous exit policy should be implemented into all programs. There may be a mixture of “early leavers” (those identified as having few or isolated essential skills gaps), with those who have broader range of needs.

Readers of all abilities can benefit from practice in the use of comprehension strategies proven to be habits of effective readers. Success in technical training and in the trades requires that apprentices understand, connect with and recall important information. Knowing the language of the trade and developing strategies to quickly locate specific information in reading materials such as code books, manuals and texts will not only increase reader comprehension but also productivity on the job.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Just as it is important to think about reading and study habits, it is important to think about strategies to be used during the exam writing. Whether writing tests that are required during technical training or getting ready to write the Red Seal certification exam, adequate test preparation is essential. As multiple choice testing is the most common form of assessment for certification, knowing how multiple choice questions are constructed and applying strategies for responding can significantly improve test scores.

Technical Reading in the Steamfitting-Pipefitting and Plumbing Trades

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Steamfitters-pipefitters and plumbers use technical reading on a daily basis to complete job tasks. The complexity of these reading tasks, according to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada’s Essential Skills profiles (http://srv108.services.gc.ca/) varies slightly between steamfitters-pipefitters and plumbers. The complexity of tasks performed by steamfitters-pipefitters ranges from reading short texts to locating a single piece of information (i.e., read minutes of project meetings or memos to stay current on project decisions) to integrating and synthesizing information from multiple sources or from complex and lengthy text (i.e., refer to and read multiple professional codes to ensure that the process followed meets industry requirements.)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The complexity of tasks performed by plumbers ranges from reading short texts to locate a single piece of information (i.e., read brochures from suppliers to obtain information on materials) to choosing and integrating information from various sources or from several parts of a single text (i.e., read project specifications at the outset of a job to plan work and to identify potential problems and risks).

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Steamfitter-pipefitters read manufacturers’ manuals for instructions on using, installing, maintaining and troubleshooting equipment. They read pipefitting textbooks to understand when a specific system is appropriate and also to review

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Page 3 Plumber NOC 7251 Steamfitter/Pipefitter NOC 7252

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

technical procedures. They must be able to identify the sequence of tasks in order to follow procedures such as flushing or cleaning.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Plumbers read manuals to install, repair and maintain plumbing fixtures and systems. They read textbooks to understand the science of the trade and to interpret laws and regulations on workplace health and safety. They refer to and read the Canadian Plumbing Code to ensure that the process they follow meets industry requirements and complies with municipal bylaws and other codes. In many cases, the text used by both steamfitters-pipefitters and plumbers is complex, lengthy and technical.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Introduction to the Curriculum Guide

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Success in technical training and performance on the job requires that apprentices have strong Essential Skills. Although all Essential Skills contribute to success, this guide is intended to help apprentices in the steamfitter-pipefitter and plumber trades develop the reading strategies necessary to locate, understand, interpret and recall information presented in a variety of text formats common to the trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It is assumed that the instruction for the Technical Reading course will not be time- tabled as such, but instructors will use a cross-curricular approach to incorporate reading strategies using the materials of the trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The following guide outlines a list of recommended resources (See Appendix A) for each objective in the Technical Reading curriculum framework and, where possible, includes online website materials that complement these resources. Three formats are provided to allow learners the opportunity to review competencies in a way that best suit their needs. These resources are categorized as follows:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Non-contextualized - Curriculum resources that are not related to any trade or occupation. These resources may be used to review the competencies in a stand-alone manner before transferring the skill to trade- related materials.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Contextualized - Curriculum resources that provide Essential Skills applications in the context of a specific trade or occupation.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Technical - Trade training materials from which Essential Skills are extracted. For the purpose of the Trade Essentials project, Individual Learning Modules from Alberta Advanced Education were used as the primary technical resource.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Note: Though only some modules are outlined as resources for specific objectives,

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

all Individual Learning Modules can be used for the instruction of Essential

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The list of resources has been designed to act only as a guide and may, therefore, need to be adapted to meet the needs of individuals or groups. It is the role of you, the instructor, to choose materials and deliver its content as it best suits individual learner needs. A variety of materials are listed under each set of competencies for this purpose. The following websites contain plumbing- and fitting-related as well as generic content which may be used as an additional reading forum.

Learners will use strategies for locating, retrieving, interpreting and entering information in/from documents and for creating trade documents

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Introduction Document Use (DU) tasks involve the process of locating, organizing and using information in different visual displays that include words, numbers and diagrams. These visual materials efficiently summarize large amounts of information in a small amount of space and are widely used in trade occupations. Apprentices must be proficient document users if they are to be successful in technical training and in job performance. This guide has been developed to provide apprentices with strategies to use trade documents quickly, efficiently and accurately. Learners will locate, interpret and evaluate information in documents and will create documents common to their trade. Understanding document structure and the strategies for using them will lead to more efficient information processing. For the purpose of the Trade Essentials project, documents have been categorized and defined as follows: � List – A document that records items in a row. � Table- A document that arranges information in rows and columns. � Form – A document which contains blanks for the insertion of pre-specified information. � Chart- A document that is used primarily to make large quantities of data easier to understand, illustrates the relationship between different parts of the data and commonly presents information as plots with reference to an axis. Charts are generally graphical in nature and contain very little text. Examples of charts include pie chart, flow chart, bar graph, line graph, histogram and pictogram. � Graphic Document – A document which portrays information as an imitation of the real world. Examples of graphic documents include pictures, diagrams, drawings, blueprints, schematics, maps, symbols, signs and icons.

The following guide outlines a list of recommended resources (See Appendix A) for each objective in the Document Use curriculum framework and, where possible, includes online website materials that complement these resources. Three formats are provided to allow learners the opportunity to review competencies in a way that best suits their needs. These resources are categorized below:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Note: Though only some modules are outlined as resources for specific objectives, all Individual Learning Modules can be used for the instruction of Essential Skills. The list of resources has been designed to act only as a guide and may, therefore, need to be adapted to meet the needs of individuals or groups. It is the role of you, the instructor, to choose materials and deliver their content as it best suits individual learner needs. A variety of materials are listed under each set of competencies for this purpose. Document Use in the Steamfitter-Pipefitter and Plumber Trades Steamfitters-pipefitters and plumbers use documents on a daily basis to complete job tasks. The complexity of these tasks, according to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada’s Essential Skills Profiles (http://srv108.services.gc.ca/), ranges from using very simple brief text with uncomplicated structure (i.e., read work schedules/read point-form notes from daily logbooks to track work progress) to using complex documents with multiple pieces of information organized into multiple sections (i.e., interpret blueprints to check locations of piping and catch basins for drainage systems/ Interpret three-dimensional structural and architectural plans).

Learners will understand, interpret and manipulate mathematical concepts in order to solve problems and complete tasks.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Principles of Mathematics (PM) is an introduction to the foundational math skills necessary for successful technical training and effective job task completion. The intent of the unit is twofold: to review and to further develop the concepts and strategies necessary for solving problems and completing tasks in the steamfitting- pipefitting and plumbing trades.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Technical - Trade training materials from which Essential Skills are extracted. For the purpose of the Trade Essentials project, Individual Learning Modules from Alberta Advanced Education and Modern Plumbing by E. Keith Blankenbaker were used as the primary technical resources.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Note: Though only some modules are outlined as resources for specific objectives, all Individual Learning Modules can be used for the instruction of Essential Skills.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The following list has been designed to act only as a guide and may, therefore, need to be adapted to meet the needs of individuals or groups. It is the role of you, the instructor, to choose materials and deliver its content as it best suits individual learner needs. A variety of materials are listed under each set of competencies for this purpose.

Steamfitters/Pipefitters, Plumbers and Numeracy

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Steamfitters/Pipefitters and Plumbers often use the skills outlined in the Principles of Mathematics on a daily basis to complete job tasks. The complexity of these tasks, according to HRSDC’s Essential Skills profiles (http://srv108.services.gc.ca/), ranges from simple, clearly-defined mathematical operations (i.e., identify acceptable level of particles per million in piping system/ Schedule daily activities to complete assigned tasks) to tasks that involve multiple steps of calculation (i.e., use trigonometry to calculate offsets and rolling offsets when installing fittings in piping systems/ Calculate rolling offsets to design, fabricate, and install pipe).

Note: Calculators are used to improve speed and accuracy of calculations; however,

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

it is important to note that calculators are tools and are only accurate if they

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

are used properly. It is very important to have an understanding of order of

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

operations when using calculators.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Only resources that specifically refer to calculators are outlined here; however, calculator-use skills should be practiced with all identified resources.

Introduction Success in technical training and effective job performance requires strong Essential Skills. Although all Essential Skills contribute to success, this guide is intended to help apprentices develop positive oral communication (OC) for their trade. Competence in oral communication provides the foundation for better performance in technical training, both on the job and when mentoring new apprentices. Strong oral communication skills are required in every occupation. In fact, many surveys indicate that it is one of the most highly valued skills among employers as it is intimately tied to everyday workplace functions. Oral communication in trade occupations is usually presented face-to-face, by telephone, or by two-way radio with a number of factors affecting the transfer of the message. The following guide is an introduction to the basic principles and methods of oral communication with an emphasis on the importance of speaking, listening and interacting in the context of customer service and interpersonal communication. A list of resources (See Appendix A) has been outlined for each objective in the Oral Communication curriculum framework and, where possible, includes online website materials that complement these resources. All information is presented in a generic manner; the contextualization to specific trades will be found in the expected tasks of each trade, determined by the instructor.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Oral Communication in Trades Occupations To make the most of technical training, apprentices need to develop strategies for effective listening, as well as the confidence and speaking skills to ask for help. These same strategies are used in the workplace to interact with co-workers, supervisors, workers in other trades, suppliers and customers. Understanding the many elements in the communications process helps apprentices send clear messages and understand the messages received. Trades people communicate orally on a daily basis to complete job tasks. The complexity of these tasks, according to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada’s Essential Skills Profiles (http://srv108.services.gc.ca/), varies slightly

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Page 83 Plumber NOC 7251 Steamfitter/Pipefitter NOC 7252

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

among the thirteen trades outlined in the Trade Essentials project (See Curriculum Guidebook). All thirteen trades describe the least complex oral communication tasks as those containing some or all of the following characteristics:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Limited oral communication demands � Narrow range of subject matter � Familiar topic � One main issue � Factual, literal or concrete language � Narrow range of content and context-specific or technical vocabulary � Clearly defined role of speaker � Interaction with one person at a time � Low risk � Brief exchange (less than 10 minutes)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The most difficult tasks vary among the trades. The most complex tasks performed by cooks, welders, carpenters, automotive service technicians, steamfitters- pipefitters, cabinetmakers, machinists, industrial and construction electricians and metal fabricators contain some or all the following characteristics:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Extensive oral communication demands � Significant range of subject matter � Professional, organizational, theoretical social issues � Abstract and conceptual language � Extensive range of technical vocabulary and idiom � Complex and detailed information content � Unpredictable context � Various communication venues used � Significant range of formats and styles � Communicator may have more than one role � New and unfamiliar situation and setting � Medium to extended (30+ minutes) exchange � Significant noise or interference � Significant level of risk

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The most complex oral communication tasks performed by plumbers, oil burner mechanics and refrigeration and air conditioning mechanics contain some or all of the following characteristics:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Moderate oral communication demands � Narrow range of subject matter � Familiar topic � Usually one main issue � Factual or concrete and abstract language

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Page 84 Plumber NOC 7251 Steamfitter/Pipefitter NOC 7252

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Moderate range of general and context-specific or technical vocabulary and idiom � Moderately complex and detailed content � Less predictable context � Interaction is frequently one-on-one or with several people � Give a short talk or give directions to a small group � Select from a moderate range of formats and styles � Established rules � Brief to moderate (10-30 minutes) exchange � Physical conditions may impede communication � Moderate level of risk � May be one-on-one hostility Upon completion of this course, apprentices will better understand how communication skills impact safety, productivity, job satisfaction and job progression. Effective communication skills will benefit apprentices as they reach journeyperson status and as they accept additional responsibility for supervising and mentoring new employees. For specific information and examples of the use of oral communication for each trade, instructors should refer to the Essential Skills Profile and the National Occupational Analysis. It should be noted that, according to HRSDC’s Essential Skills profiles, oral communication is one of the most important Essential Skills for cooks, plumbers and automotive service technicians as these tradespeople interact frequently with customers. Note: It is intended that the oral communication curriculum be embedded in other Essential Skills curricula where possible. Many of the competencies in oral communication and the five other essential skills may be mastered concurrently.

The workforce is constantly changing. Today’s employees are highly mobile, expect continuous learning to be an integral part of their job, and are adapting to a technological world. In fact, technology has changed the very fabric of the workplace and, as a result, workers are expected to acquire a broad range of skills if they are to remain current, accurate and competitive. Trades occupations are no exception. For example: automation in plants and factories have demanded an increased knowledge of networking and software use; lathes and cutting tools are often linked to computers; and entrepreneurs require skills in word processing, accounting, e-mail and internet use and database management.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

This Computer Use (CU) course has been designed to help workers adapt to this ever-changing society. It is intended for individuals who are inexperienced computer users but who want to gain some hands-on skill and confidence. It assumes no previous knowledge of computers and will provide learners with a broad overview of computer and internet technology. The following major topic areas are explored:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Computer Operations � Word Processing � File Management � Spreadsheets � Email � Web Browsing � Safe Use of Computers

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

This following guide outlines a list of recommended resources (see Appendix A) for each objective in the Computer Use curriculum framework and, where possible, includes online website materials that complement these resources. Because computer skills are generic in the workplace, this course is not contextualized to specific trades. Apprentices, however, should be provided with examples of how computers are used in their respective trades. Contextualized website lists are provided in Appendix B.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Note: The computer use curriculum can be used in one of two ways: as a stand-alone

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

course or embedded in other Essential Skills curriculum. For instance, computer use

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

competencies (i.e., email, word processing) and writing competencies may be

Learners will write to communicate for a variety of purposes

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Effective written communication is the backbone to any workplace or organization. More specifically, good communication skills reduce the chance of faulty interpretation, which, in turn, allows for maximum productivity.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

As the economy changes, so too, does the workplace. Necessary reorganization and technological change demand that workers who would generally not be responsible for a high level of workplace writing are now expected to communicate internally and externally on a regular basis though memos, emails, faxes and reports.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The following guide is an introduction to the key writing skills workers need to deal effectively with everyday written correspondence and business communications and provides strategies to help learners improve their ability to write.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

A list of resources (see Appendix A) has been outlined for each objective in the Writing Curriculum Framework and, where possible, includes online website materials that complement these resources. All information is presented in a generic manner; the contextualization to specific trades will be found in the expected writing tasks of each trade, determined by the instructor.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Outlined below are examples of writing tasks performed by tradespeople. These tasks may be used as a basis for writing expectations.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Steamfitter/Pipefitter NOC 7262

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION Points to Consider

� 80% of learning in a trade happens in the workplace. � Every workplace in every province and territory has its own unique learning culture. � Each journeyperson has their individual approach to guiding an apprentice. � Every apprentice will write the same national exam.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The road to a trade certification has many paths. For an apprentice who has not taken the pre-apprentice training and Block/Period/Level in-school route, it can be a difficult road to navigate. The primary focus appears to be accumulating enough hours for eligibility to challenge the Interprovincial (Red Seal) Exam.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The one tool that is available, if an apprentice chooses the Block/Period/Level route, is the Provincial Log Book. This Log Book tracks the Blocks, Tasks and Sub-tasks that an apprentice has learned in the workplace. For apprentices who have chosen the route through which 100% of their learning happens in the workplace, it can be difficult to “know what you don’t know.” On this path the apprentices never had a log book, so in order to challenge, they have their journeyperson sign off on the blocks when they have accumulated the hours required to challenge the IP certification exam in their trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Provincial/territorial log books are developed from the National Occupational Analysis (NOA) in a trade. Most apprentices are never introduced to the NOA of their trade even though it is used to develop trades curriculum, block/period/level tests and the IP exam.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Technical Skills Inventory (TSI)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Technical Skills Inventory (TSI) is created from the NOA. It is a self- assessment tool designed to give apprentices the opportunity to reflect on their technical skills, identify skills gaps and make a plan to fill those gaps before they challenge the IP exam.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The TSI also provides information for Essential Skills assessors to create technical skills learning plans for individual apprentices and Essentials Skills program instructors. These learning plans are used by the instructor and the apprentice to select technical skills resources that support Essential Skills learning programs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The TSI “Group Summary” has formulas imbedded so data can be easily extracted and manipulated for presentation in a pie chart format.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS (NOA)

The NOA is the national standard for a trade and it is:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• a list of all the skills in a trade;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• used to create curriculum for trade school programs and Block Release/Period programs in a trade;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• used to create a Log Book that records an apprentice’s progress in the general skill areas of a trade;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• used to create all the questions for the Interprovincial (Red Seal) Exam. �

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

TECHNICAL SKILLS INVENTORY (TSI) � The TSI is created from the NOA and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• gives a general picture of the technical skills required for a trade;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• contains the same information as an apprentice log book;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

• guides an instructor in choosing learning materials for an Essential Skills program.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## STEP ONE: INTRODUCE PARTICIPANTS TO THE NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS (NOA)

The NOA is recognized as the national standard for all trades. There is an NOA for each trade in Canada and, although the NOAs are readily accessible online, few tradespeople take advantage of this information. (To access NOAs on line, go to www.red-seal.ca and click on national occupational analysis)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

An NOA is reviewed and revised at least every five years. Each NOA is developed by a Joint Planning Committee and the Interprovincial Program Guide Working Group, comprised of industry and instructional representatives in a specific trade from each province and territory in Canada. All Joint Planning Committees operate under the auspices of the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship (CCDA) which recognizes the NOA as the key document in an occupation. The CCDA consists of directors/managers of apprenticeship from every province and territory in Canada.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� lists every technical skill requirement in a trade; � is used to create the apprentice log book in a trade; � is used to develop curriculum for trades training programs; and � is used to develop the questions for Interprovincial (Red Seal) Exam.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Have an NOA printed for each participant. Ensure each NOA has page indicators at these sections: � Analysis � Tools and Equipment � Glossary � Exam Components

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

NOTE: Move pie chart to the first page of the exam component section.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The first night of class

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Ask the participants if they have ever used, or worked in, an NOA before. If so, engage him/her in a discussion of where they used it and in what context. Then:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� distribute an NOA to each participant; � review the development and layout of the document; � emphasize the use of the document, e.g., creating a log book, curriculum, possible exam questions, etc.; and � review each section of the document with particular attention to the Blocks, Tasks and sub-tasks in the Analysis section.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*


## STEP TWO: INTRODUCE PARTICIPANTS TO THE TECHNICAL SKILLS INVENTORY (TSI)

Technical Skills Inventory (TSI)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The TSI is created from the NOA. It gives a general picture of the technical skills required for a trade by listing the Blocks, Tasks and Sub-tasks in the trade. The TSI:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Contains the same information as the Apprentice Log Book in a trade;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Provides the participant with an opportunity to self-assess his/her general skills in their trade; and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Guides the instructor in choosing contextualized resources for the Essential Skills program.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

TSI Terminology

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Two sets of terms can be used depending on where a participant learns and works in their trade. In this TSI Document, you will find the common terminology listed first. It is followed by the competency-based terminology in italics and underlined.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

TSI Terminology Blocks - Learning Categories: Tasks - Learning Outcomes: Sub-tasks - Learning Objectives

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

By completing this Technical Skills Inventory (TSI) the participant will:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� be introduced to the blocks (learning categories), the tasks (learning outcomes), and the sub-tasks (learning objectives) in the NOA;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� reflect on his/her technical skills, then list what he/she knows and can do;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� document any technical skills gaps the participant may have;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� help create a group learning needs profile to assist curriculum developers and the instructor gather learning materials specific to a trade for an Essential Skills Program; and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� help the participant make a plan for any technical skills they may need to learn or improve

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Print an NOA Analysis Diagram for each participant.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Print a Learners Guide – Technical Skills Inventory (TSI).

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Print a personalized TSI for each participant.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The first night of class

Distribute an NOA Analysis Diagram to each participant in the program and review the content with him/her. Then:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Distribute the Learner’s Guide – Technical Skills Inventory (TSI) to each participant;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Distribute the personalized TSI to each participant;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Summarize the directions for completing the TSI;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Advise the participants to review each sub-task and put a � in the column that best describes their self-assessment of their skill: o Yes, I did this o I need to work on this o Not sure what this means

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Advise participants to include any comments they may have; and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Collect TSIs when participants have completed them.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

It should take approximately 20 minutes for a participant to complete their individual TSI. If some take longer, do not rush them.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Advise participants that you will meet with them at the half-way point of the program to give them feedback on their TSI. Advise them that in the meantime, you will be collecting the information from each TSI and compiling it for the instructor so he/she can prepare materials for the Essential Skills Program.

## STEP THREE: COMPILE DATA FOR THE INSTRUCTOR

The Essential Skills Programs at Trade Essentials are contextualized to the trade. This results in participants being easily engaged in their learning because they relate to the materials that support concepts and applications in their trade. Data collected through the TSI guides the instructor as to what contextual and technical resources will best engage his/her participants.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Within 24 to 48 hours of the participants completing the TSI, provide the instructor with a TSI Group Summary Chart and Group Learning Plan.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Develop a TSI Group Summary Chart

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Complete an Excel spreadsheet assigning one column to each participant;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Assign the number code to each TSI column o 0 to the first column – Yes, I did this o 2 to the second column – I need to work on this o 3 to the third column – Not sure what this means

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Collect the data from the TSI and transfer it to the spreadsheet; and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� The 2s will automatically highlight in yellow and the 3s in blue so the instructor can easily identify a participant who has a learning need that differs significantly from the group;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� A group summary chart will appear at the bottom of your spreadsheet.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Create a Pie Chart to produce a visual depiction of a group’s learning needs

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Highlight the entire “Summary Chart” on the last page of your spreadsheet.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o On the tool bar, choose the “Chart Wizard” (Microsoft Office Excel 2003)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Under chart “Chart type” choose “Pie”

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Under “Chart Sub-Type” choose the first Pie picture

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Choose “Data Range” and “Columns” then click “Next”

## STEP FOUR: ASSIST THE PARTICIPANT TO DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUAL TECHNICAL SKILLS LEARNING PLAN

Information from the TSI is used to create an individual report for each participant. This report includes:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Information on the TSI so the participant has a record of how he/she completed this tool;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� A Pie Chart that provides a visual depiction of the participant’s learning needs; and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� A series of questions that result in each participant developing an individual technical skills learning plan.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

At the mid-point of the Essential Skills Program, provide participants with feedback on their TSI. This timeline:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� gives the participant an opportunity to focus entirely on their Essential Skills for the first few weeks of the program;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� gives the participant time to evaluate if, through their Essential Skills studies, they have discovered that their technical learning needs are more extensive than they previously assessed through their TSI;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� creates an opportunity for the participant to share how they are adjusting to a learning environment with someone other than the instructor; and

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� provides an opportunity for the assessor to gather information from each participant to determine if resources and instruction are meeting their learning needs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Develop an Individual Learning Needs Plan Pie Chart for each participant to produce a visual depiction of a participant’s learning needs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Transfer each participant’s total for each Block both SE 2 - I need to work on this and SE 3 - Not sure what this means into a Pie Chart;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Highlight all of the Block titles in the “Summary Chart” on the last page of the spreadsheet

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Hold down the Control Key (Ctrl) on your keyboard

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Highlight one client column

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Choose “Titles” and fill in “Chart Name” (Client name and Trade)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

o Choose “Edit”, then “Copy” the pie chart and “Paste” it into the “Individual Learning Plan”

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Schedule a one-on-one TSI feedback appointment with each participant during which you compare and discuss their Individual Learning Needs Pie Chart with the group Learning Needs Pie Chart

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Complete the Individual Learning Plan with the participant.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Make 2 copies of the Individual Learning Plan. Put one copy in office file and one copy in your files.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� Give the original TSI and the original Individual Learning Plan back to the participant.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Each one-on-one meeting with a client should average 20 to 30 minutes.

## SECTION 4 - LEARNER’S GUIDE

Key Document in your Trade

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The National Occupational Analysis (NOA) is a trade document approved nationally and used in each province and territory across Canada. The NOA lists every technical skill required to be successful in your trade. Each NOA is used to:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� create the apprentice log book in your trade; � develop curriculum for trades training programs; and � prepare questions for Red Seal exams.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Technical Skills Inventory (TSI)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The TSI is created from the NOA. It gives a general overview of the technical skills required for your trade by listing the Blocks, Tasks and Sub- Tasks in your trade. The TSI:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� contains the same information as the apprentice log book in your trade; and � gives you the opportunity to self-assess your general skills in your trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Two sets of terms can be used depending on where you learn and work in your trade. In this TSI document, you will find the common terms listed first. It is followed by the competency-based terms in italics and underlined. (In the future, all NOA updates will be using competency-based terms.)

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The Technical Skills Inventory (TSI) is designed to:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� introduce apprentices to the blocks (learning categories), tasks (learning outcomes), and sub-tasks (learning objectives) in the National Occupational Analysis (NOA).

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� have apprentices reflect and then self-assess their tasks (learning outcomes) and sub-tasks (learning objectives) in their trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� compile information from the TSI to create a group profile of technical skills learning needs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� provide information from the TSIs to assist instructors in choosing contextualized and technical skills resources to support Essential Skills curriculum that will support client needs.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

The TSI assessment tool lists the block (learning categories), tasks (learning outcomes) and sub-tasks (learning objectives) identified in the National Occupational Analysis (NOA) of each trade. The TSI is a self-assessment tool through which an apprentice reflects and records their personal evaluation on each task and sub-task. Self-evaluation (SE) categories for the tasks (learning outcomes) and sub-tasks (learning objectives) are:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

SE 0 – Yes, I did this

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

SE 2 – I need to work on this

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

SE 3 – Not sure what this means

GENERAL GROUP PROFILE: Steamfitter/Pipefitter Group - Charlottetown

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Nine Steamfitter/Pipefitter learners are participating in this program. The geographic territory covers from the central part of PEI to Charlottetown. Trade expertise within the group ranges from those working in specific sections of the trade to those who own their own businesses. Seven have previously challenged but were unsuccessful in the Red Seal exam. One has attended pre-apprenticeship training in a post-secondary institution.

## SECTION 8 - INDIVIDUAL LEARNING PLAN AND PIE CHART (SAMPLE)

� introduce you to the blocks (learning categories), tasks (learning outcomes) and sub-tasks (learning objectives) in the National Occupational Analysis (NOA);

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

These three sections of the NOA are used in provinces and territories to create an apprenticeship log book. The log book is used by apprentices and journeypersons to record and sign-off technical skill areas learned on the job.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� help you think about your technical skills and then help you list what you know and can do;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� help you know what technical skills to focus on as you go through your school training and while you are working under the direction of a journeyperson;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� help you make a technical skills learning plan to highlight your technical skills learning needs;

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

� help you prepare to complete a Professional Skills Record (PSR) (if needed) which lists the details and all the skill requirements in your trade.

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

Self-Assessment (SE) ratings assigned to interpret and record data are:

*Source: steamfitter_esm*

SE 0 – Yes, I did this
